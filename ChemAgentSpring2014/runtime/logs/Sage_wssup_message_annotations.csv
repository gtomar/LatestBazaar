 <h2>General Introduction</h2> 
 <p>Each member of your group has received some training materials on the intermolecular forces that hold liquids together and influence a liquid's boiling point. In particular, one of you has learned about the forces at work in liquids consisting of non-polar molecules, one of you learned about liquids composed of polar molecules, and one of you learned about ionic liquids.</p> 
 <p>We'll be asking you some questions that will give you an opportunity to teach the other members of your group about the things you've read about. In addition, we'll ask you some questions that will require your collective expertise. Make sure you discuss things with the other members of your group - because by doing so, you'll be able produce more accurate answers to the questions and you'll all learn more.</p>

 <h2>Getting on the Same Page</h2> 
 <p>Before we start looking at data that will require you to combine your respective expertise, we'll take a look at three data sets, each of which can be explained by just one of you. Looking at these data sets together will provide an opportunity for each of you to share with the other group members what you learned. Try to explain what you learned as well as you can - your group is relying on you! </p>
