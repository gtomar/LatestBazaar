Quinn (Tutor)_UCSB_5,S04,i havent been able to open the lab material yet hld on,
Quinn (Tutor)_UCSB_5,S04,ok got it open now reading it,AFFIRMATIVE
Quinn (Tutor)_UCSB_5,s12,Ok. I just got through it.,AFFIRMATIVE
Quinn (Tutor)_UCSB_5,s12,So from what I understand  We are evaluating the data from tests in order to determine the effect that the bending stress had on the specimen,FIRST_NAME+AFFIRMATIVE+QUESTION+PREDICTION_CONTRIBUTION
Quinn (Tutor)_UCSB_5,s12,as compared to the "middle "layer" test which does not apply a bending stress,FIRST_NAME
Quinn (Tutor)_UCSB_5,S04,ya that sounds about right,
Quinn (Tutor)_UCSB_5,S05,ya thats what i got out of it too,QUESTION+PREDICTION_CONTRIBUTION
Quinn (Tutor)_UCSB_5,S04,so were arranging to plots first ya?,QUESTION
Quinn (Tutor)_UCSB_5,S04,*the,
Quinn (Tutor)_UCSB_5,S05,are you on part 1 or the first question in part 2,PREDICTION_CONTRIBUTION
Quinn (Tutor)_UCSB_5,s12,Right now I'm just going through the Excel tutorial page before I jump into the questions,PREDICTION_CONTRIBUTION
Quinn (Tutor)_UCSB_5,S04,I'm reading the 'using excel to model this problem' portion,
Quinn (Tutor)_UCSB_5,s12,I realize that this sheet is designed for Windows users  but Its simple enough on a mac that it is not inhibiting,PREDICTION_CONTRIBUTION
Quinn (Tutor)_UCSB_5,S04,mm on a mac right now,
Quinn (Tutor)_UCSB_5,S04,are u gitting the 'DIV/0' error for your slopes,
Quinn (Tutor)_UCSB_5,S04,where are we supposed to submit our answers?,QUESTION
Quinn (Tutor)_UCSB_5,s12,I believe we are supposed to print them out and hand them  in tomorrow If i read correctly,FIRST_NAME+AFFIRMATIVE+EXPLANATION_CONTRIBUTION+PREDICTION_CONTRIBUTION
Quinn (Tutor)_UCSB_5,S05,ya thats what it said to do,QUESTION
Quinn (Tutor)_UCSB_5,S04,oh ok,AFFIRMATIVE
Quinn (Tutor)_UCSB_5,S04,have u guys filled out ur excel spreadsheet yet?,QUESTION+PREDICTION_CONTRIBUTION
Quinn (Tutor)_UCSB_5,s12,yes  I just got mine all completed,AFFIRMATIVE
Quinn (Tutor)_UCSB_5,S05,ya mines done,
Quinn (Tutor)_UCSB_5,S04,so the biggest graph is the displacement graph right?,QUESTION+PREDICTION_CONTRIBUTION
Quinn (Tutor)_UCSB_5,s12,with the red points  yes  I believe so,AFFIRMATIVE
Quinn (Tutor)_UCSB_5,s12,and if I also understand correctly  our "Displ via integral" graph should match that,EXPLANATION_CONTRIBUTION+PREDICTION_CONTRIBUTION
Quinn (Tutor)_UCSB_5,S04,do u guys have poly4 or poly2 data set?,QUESTION
Quinn (Tutor)_UCSB_5,s12,I have a poly 2 data set,
Quinn (Tutor)_UCSB_5,S05,i have the poly 2,
Quinn (Tutor)_UCSB_5,S04,darn i have poly4,
Quinn (Tutor)_UCSB_5,S04,so ur guys displacement curve is concave down?,QUESTION+PREDICTION_CONTRIBUTION
Quinn (Tutor)_UCSB_5,s12,yes,AFFIRMATIVE
Quinn (Tutor)_UCSB_5,S05,yes,AFFIRMATIVE
Quinn (Tutor)_UCSB_5,s12,have ya'll started on the questions yet?,QUESTION
Quinn (Tutor)_UCSB_5,S05,just starting the first one,
Quinn (Tutor)_UCSB_5,S04,ya im starting the first one,
Quinn (Tutor)_UCSB_5,s12,did you just state that the end at x = 0 is the only one experiencing the vertical displacement?,QUESTION
Quinn (Tutor)_UCSB_5,S05,ya,
Quinn (Tutor)_UCSB_5,s12,same w/ rotation as well?,FIRST_NAME+QUESTION
Quinn (Tutor)_UCSB_5,S05,thats what i got,QUESTION
Quinn (Tutor)_UCSB_5,s12,shweet,
Quinn (Tutor)_UCSB_5,S05,i think thats it for the first question,EXPLANATION_CONTRIBUTION
Quinn (Tutor)_UCSB_5,s12,Yup  I'm movin on to #2,AFFIRMATIVE
Quinn (Tutor)_UCSB_5,S04,wait why is it only at x = 0?,QUESTION
Quinn (Tutor)_UCSB_5,s12,at x = 97  based on the graph  the specimen is not experiencing any displacement,
Quinn (Tutor)_UCSB_5,s12,as it arrives at Z=0,
Quinn (Tutor)_UCSB_5,S04,ah yes,AFFIRMATIVE
Quinn (Tutor)_UCSB_5,S04,and #2 is just the EIv'' = M relationships right?,QUESTION
Quinn (Tutor)_UCSB_5,s12,still tryin to figure that out  but yes  I think thats what they're referring to,AFFIRMATIVE+EXPLANATION_CONTRIBUTION+QUESTION+PREDICTION_CONTRIBUTION
Quinn (Tutor)_UCSB_5,s12,at least with the first relationship,
Quinn (Tutor)_UCSB_5,S05,ya i think its that one and then the other two integrated forms of it,EXPLANATION_CONTRIBUTION+PREDICTION_CONTRIBUTION
Quinn (Tutor)_UCSB_5,S04,thats the curvature relationship than u just integrate from there and each integration is a diff relationship,PREDICTION_CONTRIBUTION
Quinn (Tutor)_UCSB_5,S04,ya,
Quinn (Tutor)_UCSB_5,s12,yup yup,AFFIRMATIVE
Quinn (Tutor)_UCSB_5,S05,ok so moving on to question 3 now,AFFIRMATIVE
Quinn (Tutor)_UCSB_5,S04,ya,
Quinn (Tutor)_UCSB_5,S04,so each specimen has the same second moment of area I'm assuming?,FIRST_NAME+QUESTION
Quinn (Tutor)_UCSB_5,S05,ya that what it sounds like,QUESTION
Quinn (Tutor)_UCSB_5,S04,so im thinking were using the max stress = My/I relation in some way  maybe relating it to the curvature graph  for part a?,IDEA_CONTRIBUTION+QUESTION+PREDICTION_CONTRIBUTION
Quinn (Tutor)_UCSB_5,S04,im not sure how to answer part 'a' yet but i think i have 'b',AFFIRMATIVE+EXPLANATION_CONTRIBUTION
Quinn (Tutor)_UCSB_5,S05,,
Quinn (Tutor)_UCSB_5,S05,what did you get for b,QUESTION
Quinn (Tutor)_UCSB_5,s12,You just going off data from the graph?,QUESTION
Quinn (Tutor)_UCSB_5,s12,er,
Quinn (Tutor)_UCSB_5,s12,spreadsheet,
Quinn (Tutor)_UCSB_5,S04,if u look at that curvature graph the maximum curvature  at least for mine  is at x=12.44  so just based on the fact M is proportional to curvature (EIv'' = M) I think thats the point of maximum bending stress,FIRST_NAME+EXPLANATION_CONTRIBUTION
Quinn (Tutor)_UCSB_5,s12,hmm,
Quinn (Tutor)_UCSB_5,s12,on mine (poly2) the curvature at 12.44 is not a maximum,
Quinn (Tutor)_UCSB_5,S04,ya mines poly4 so theyre prob different,
Quinn (Tutor)_UCSB_5,s12,On Poly2 I'd say that the max hangs around 8.09  where v' = ~0 so you know thats a peak,
Quinn (Tutor)_UCSB_5,s12,which correlates with the graph  etc,
Quinn (Tutor)_UCSB_5,S05,ya i agree with that,
Quinn (Tutor)_UCSB_5,S04,x=12.44 is also the pt were my displacement graph's slope goes from being positive to neative,
Quinn (Tutor)_UCSB_5,s12,so we're still kinda stuck on a)?,QUESTION
Quinn (Tutor)_UCSB_5,S04,ya im a little confused on the relationship between the top and bottom specimens,FIRST_NAME
Quinn (Tutor)_UCSB_5,S04,and how it would effect their bending stresses,FIRST_NAME
Quinn (Tutor)_UCSB_5,S04,but I guess we know now that their respective max bending stresses are NOT at the same point,FIRST_NAME
Quinn (Tutor)_UCSB_5,s12,mmhmm,
Quinn (Tutor)_UCSB_5,s12,Just the way it is worded is somewhat vague,
Quinn (Tutor)_UCSB_5,s12,I mean  they're similar...the difference between the locations of maximum stress is only 4 ,
Quinn (Tutor)_UCSB_5,s12,whic4%,
Quinn (Tutor)_UCSB_5,S04,right they are similar i was thinking they were asking if they were the same,FIRST_NAME+EXPLANATION_CONTRIBUTION
Quinn (Tutor)_UCSB_5,S05,ya i think theyre suppose to be similar but each tests leads to slightly different results,EXPLANATION_CONTRIBUTION
Quinn (Tutor)_UCSB_5,s12,i mean  I would say yes  and state that as reasoning  that they both feature a ridged end (at x = ~97  while they both have the "gripped" edge at x = 0 leading to similar  but not exactly the same  results,FIRST_NAME+AFFIRMATIVE+EXPLANATION_CONTRIBUTION
Quinn (Tutor)_UCSB_5,S04,ok I still cant figure out why a bending stress is applied when they are testing both the top and bottom layers,FIRST_NAME+AFFIRMATIVE+PREDICTION_CONTRIBUTION
Quinn (Tutor)_UCSB_5,S04,but maybe im thinking too hard,IDEA_CONTRIBUTION
Quinn (Tutor)_UCSB_5,s12,nor can I,
Quinn (Tutor)_UCSB_5,s12,I was wondering about that when reading,
Quinn (Tutor)_UCSB_5,s12,i think it might have to do with the fact that the force pulling on the specimen is applied directly to the center of the gripping assembly,EXPLANATION_CONTRIBUTION
Quinn (Tutor)_UCSB_5,S04,right i think thats it,EXPLANATION_CONTRIBUTION
Quinn (Tutor)_UCSB_5,S04,cuz they say if its in the middle layer there is no bending stress,FIRST_NAME+EXPLANATION_CONTRIBUTION+IDEA_CONTRIBUTION+PREDICTION_CONTRIBUTION
Quinn (Tutor)_UCSB_5,s12,so when it pulls back  it creates a moment on the assembly  which in turn is applied to the specimen itself,AFFIRMATIVE+PREDICTION_CONTRIBUTION
Quinn (Tutor)_UCSB_5,S04,so I would think by that reasoning that they should experience max bending stresses  at similar points,FIRST_NAME+EXPLANATION_CONTRIBUTION
Quinn (Tutor)_UCSB_5,S04,just the bending stresses would be in opposite directions,FIRST_NAME+PREDICTION_CONTRIBUTION
Quinn (Tutor)_UCSB_5,S04,hence us having different concavity in our displacement graphs,EXPLANATION_CONTRIBUTION+IDEA_CONTRIBUTION+PREDICTION_CONTRIBUTION
Quinn (Tutor)_UCSB_5,s12,mmhm,
Quinn (Tutor)_UCSB_5,S05,so thats the answer to 3a but where is the max acting on the specimen,
Quinn (Tutor)_UCSB_5,S04,at the pt of max curvature right?,QUESTION
Quinn (Tutor)_UCSB_5,s12,that would seem to make the most sense,IDEA_CONTRIBUTION
Quinn (Tutor)_UCSB_5,s12,based on what we've been learning  etc,QUESTION
Quinn (Tutor)_UCSB_5,S04,so for me its x= 12.44 where is it for u guys again?,QUESTION
Quinn (Tutor)_UCSB_5,s12, ~8.9,
Quinn (Tutor)_UCSB_5,s12,er,
Quinn (Tutor)_UCSB_5,s12,8.09,
Quinn (Tutor)_UCSB_5,S05,ya or 9.3 they seem to be the same,FIRST_NAME
Quinn (Tutor)_UCSB_5,S04,ya so along a 97 um a 4 um diff isnt that significant,
Quinn (Tutor)_UCSB_5,s12,not at all,
Quinn (Tutor)_UCSB_5,S04,and my um i mean micrometer,
Quinn (Tutor)_UCSB_5,S04,or watever it is,
Quinn (Tutor)_UCSB_5,s12,haha,
Quinn (Tutor)_UCSB_5,S04,nanometer,
Quinn (Tutor)_UCSB_5,S04,ok so we moving unto #4 then?,AFFIRMATIVE+QUESTION
Quinn (Tutor)_UCSB_5,s12,sounds good to me,
Quinn (Tutor)_UCSB_5,S05,ya,
Quinn (Tutor)_UCSB_5,s12,looks like we're ahead of schedule then :P,
Quinn (Tutor)_UCSB_5,S04,woot!,FIRST_NAME
Quinn (Tutor)_UCSB_5,S04,so first thing im thinking is using to EIv'' = M relation again we use that max curvature pt. as v'' obtain a value for M (E and I are given) than plug that into the maxstress = My/I equation,PREDICTION_CONTRIBUTION
Quinn (Tutor)_UCSB_5,S04,and the specimen is a rectangular cross section?,QUESTION
Quinn (Tutor)_UCSB_5,s12,yup  thats what I was thinking as well.,AFFIRMATIVE+QUESTION
Quinn (Tutor)_UCSB_5,S05,ya thats what im assuming,QUESTION
Quinn (Tutor)_UCSB_5,S05,they gave us a b and h so a rectangle makes sense,EXPLANATION_CONTRIBUTION
Quinn (Tutor)_UCSB_5,S04,ok so I = (1/12)(2)(2.25^3),AFFIRMATIVE
Quinn (Tutor)_UCSB_5,S04,=1.89,
Quinn (Tutor)_UCSB_5,s12,1.90  but close enough ;),
Quinn (Tutor)_UCSB_5,S04,ha goddamit I hate units  do we have to convert GPa's to something or the nanometers to meters? ,QUESTION
Quinn (Tutor)_UCSB_5,s12,well curvature should be a unitless value,
Quinn (Tutor)_UCSB_5,s12,so you dont have to worry about that,
Quinn (Tutor)_UCSB_5,s12,and we're trying to get out GPa's anyways,PREDICTION_CONTRIBUTION
Quinn (Tutor)_UCSB_5,S04,right I'm just talkin about multiply E*I,
Quinn (Tutor)_UCSB_5,s12,I think it should just be a direct multiplication,EXPLANATION_CONTRIBUTION
Quinn (Tutor)_UCSB_5,s12,er,
Quinn (Tutor)_UCSB_5,s12,nevermind,
Quinn (Tutor)_UCSB_5,s12,you're right  dimensions are dumb,
Quinn (Tutor)_UCSB_5,S04,just another annoying thing to consider,
Quinn (Tutor)_UCSB_5,S04,i think we have to convert nanometers to meters,EXPLANATION_CONTRIBUTION
Quinn (Tutor)_UCSB_5,S04,and Giga is 10^9 or 10^6?,QUESTION
Quinn (Tutor)_UCSB_5,s12,1 um = 1.0 *10^-9?,QUESTION
Quinn (Tutor)_UCSB_5,S04,i thought it was 10^-6 i could be wrong though,EXPLANATION_CONTRIBUTION+IDEA_CONTRIBUTION
Quinn (Tutor)_UCSB_5,s12,ok yea  we're working with micro inches,AFFIRMATIVE+PREDICTION_CONTRIBUTION
Quinn (Tutor)_UCSB_5,s12,which are 10^-6,
Quinn (Tutor)_UCSB_5,S04,no ur right,
Quinn (Tutor)_UCSB_5,S05,its 10^9,
Quinn (Tutor)_UCSB_5,S04,it is 0^-9,

Quinn (Tutor)_UCSB_5,S04,10^-9,
Quinn (Tutor)_UCSB_5,S04,wait nvm,
Quinn (Tutor)_UCSB_5,S04,im confused,
Quinn (Tutor)_UCSB_5,S05,micro is 10^-6 ,
Quinn (Tutor)_UCSB_5,S04,hah yes thats it,AFFIRMATIVE
Quinn (Tutor)_UCSB_5,S04,i was thinkin it was nano,
Quinn (Tutor)_UCSB_5,S04,so its 10^-6,
Quinn (Tutor)_UCSB_5,s12,hooray for greek letters!,
Quinn (Tutor)_UCSB_5,s12,anyhow,
Quinn (Tutor)_UCSB_5,S04,hah ya jeez thats annoying  Giga is 10^9?,QUESTION

Quinn (Tutor)_UCSB_5,s12,that should be right for yours,
Quinn (Tutor)_UCSB_5,S04,ok cool so now we multiply that by (h/2) and divide it by I?,AFFIRMATIVE+QUESTION
Quinn (Tutor)_UCSB_5,s12,I would suppose so,
Quinn (Tutor)_UCSB_5,S04,ok im getting 645.75 or Pa or 6.45e-7 GPa,AFFIRMATIVE

Quinn (Tutor)_UCSB_5,S05,i think were almost done,EXPLANATION_CONTRIBUTION
Quinn (Tutor)_UCSB_5,s12,yea  for %#5 I'm just saying that the values are so small compared to the tensile ones that they don't contribute to the failure,PREDICTION_CONTRIBUTION
Quinn (Tutor)_UCSB_5,S05,so the meaured tensile strengths are going to be fairly accurate,
Quinn (Tutor)_UCSB_5,S04,alright so we just have to print out the integrated slope vs. distance plot and the answers to these questions?,AFFIRMATIVE+QUESTION+PREDICTION_CONTRIBUTION
Quinn (Tutor)_UCSB_5,s12,I believe so.,

Quinn (Tutor)_UCSB_5,s12,but the curvature is 1/micron,
Quinn (Tutor)_UCSB_5,S04,oh shit good call,FIRST_NAME
Quinn (Tutor)_UCSB_5,s12,which just means we need to multiply our final values by 10^6,
