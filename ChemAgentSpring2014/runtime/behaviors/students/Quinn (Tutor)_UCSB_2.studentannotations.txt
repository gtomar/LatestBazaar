Quinn (Tutor)_UCSB_2,s10,Ok give me  a minute to read,AFFIRMATIVE
Quinn (Tutor)_UCSB_2,S01,hi S10,
Quinn (Tutor)_UCSB_2,s10,hello  I'm still reading  but it says we need to complete the first part individually,PREDICTION_CONTRIBUTION
Quinn (Tutor)_UCSB_2,S01,yeah,AFFIRMATIVE
Quinn (Tutor)_UCSB_2,s10,So it looks like part 1 is already completed? I'm doing poly2 btw,QUESTION
Quinn (Tutor)_UCSB_2,S01,how is it completed? I am still still reading the tutorial,AFFIRMATIVE+QUESTION
Quinn (Tutor)_UCSB_2,s10,the excel page I opened has data  and plots already made,
Quinn (Tutor)_UCSB_2,s10,They need modifications  nevermind,
Quinn (Tutor)_UCSB_2,S01,yeah i am following the steps to modify it,AFFIRMATIVE
Quinn (Tutor)_UCSB_2,S01,ok for part 1 ... all we need to do is that copy and paste modification?,AFFIRMATIVE+QUESTION
Quinn (Tutor)_UCSB_2,s10,yep done,AFFIRMATIVE
Quinn (Tutor)_UCSB_2,s10,so let me try something,
Quinn (Tutor)_UCSB_2,s10,there's my plot,
Quinn (Tutor)_UCSB_2,s10,paste yours,
Quinn (Tutor)_UCSB_2,S01,,
Quinn (Tutor)_UCSB_2,s10,hokay I see the similarities,
Quinn (Tutor)_UCSB_2,S01,same,FIRST_NAME
Quinn (Tutor)_UCSB_2,S01,do we need to print these out and give them to the professor?,QUESTION+PREDICTION_CONTRIBUTION
Quinn (Tutor)_UCSB_2,s10,I'm not sure if that applies to us at UCSB  but it doesn't hurt,AFFIRMATIVE+EXPLANATION_CONTRIBUTION
Quinn (Tutor)_UCSB_2,s10,anyway on to part 2 questions,
Quinn (Tutor)_UCSB_2,s10,So judging by the description of the experiment  it seems that the only way this bending can be caused is through endpoint constraints,FIRST_NAME+EXPLANATION_CONTRIBUTION
Quinn (Tutor)_UCSB_2,S01,do we write down answers on a piece of paper?,QUESTION+PREDICTION_CONTRIBUTION
Quinn (Tutor)_UCSB_2,s10,No it's got to be on here,
Quinn (Tutor)_UCSB_2,S01,oh,
Quinn (Tutor)_UCSB_2,S01,but it says individual solution,PREDICTION_CONTRIBUTION
Quinn (Tutor)_UCSB_2,s10,really? yeah ok,AFFIRMATIVE+QUESTION
Quinn (Tutor)_UCSB_2,s10,well I saying that problem 2 asks about displacement and rotation at the ends of the beam,
Quinn (Tutor)_UCSB_2,s10,and I guess the answer is that both ends have displacement and rotation,
Quinn (Tutor)_UCSB_2,s10,we can determine that from the spreadsheet,IDEA_CONTRIBUTION
Quinn (Tutor)_UCSB_2,S01,what condition on vertical displacement and slope are being applied at each end?,QUESTION
Quinn (Tutor)_UCSB_2,s10,mine has displacement of 66.6 micrometers at one end  and 0 at the other,
Quinn (Tutor)_UCSB_2,s10,no .666,
Quinn (Tutor)_UCSB_2,S01,how do u find out?,QUESTION+PREDICTION_CONTRIBUTION
Quinn (Tutor)_UCSB_2,s10,cell B1=.666  cell B314(last one)=0,
Quinn (Tutor)_UCSB_2,s10,the slope depends on whether you're using the slope  smoothed slope  or integrated slope,PREDICTION_CONTRIBUTION
Quinn (Tutor)_UCSB_2,s10,data,
Quinn (Tutor)_UCSB_2,S01,the first data on my slope via integral column is J14= -0.018249589,PREDICTION_CONTRIBUTION
Quinn (Tutor)_UCSB_2,s10,On mine slope is about .0118 at one end  and 0 at the other,
Quinn (Tutor)_UCSB_2,S01,J300= 0.010260719,
Quinn (Tutor)_UCSB_2,s10,well row 14 corresponds to x displacement of ~3.7 micrometers  so that would not be the initial slope,PREDICTION_CONTRIBUTION
Quinn (Tutor)_UCSB_2,S01,J1 is an empty box,
Quinn (Tutor)_UCSB_2,s10,I'm using the measured slope(col D),
Quinn (Tutor)_UCSB_2,S01,the Z slope??????,QUESTION
Quinn (Tutor)_UCSB_2,S01,D4= -0.025249676,
Quinn (Tutor)_UCSB_2,S01,D321 = -5.23699E-05,
Quinn (Tutor)_UCSB_2,s10,great  final slope is essentially 0,
Quinn (Tutor)_UCSB_2,S01,i dont get it... how do u know that?,QUESTION
Quinn (Tutor)_UCSB_2,s10,visually  just look at the plot in red of the beams shape,PREDICTION_CONTRIBUTION
Quinn (Tutor)_UCSB_2,s10,the riht end clearly has slope of 0  and y axis value of 0,PREDICTION_CONTRIBUTION
Quinn (Tutor)_UCSB_2,S01,yes i know that,AFFIRMATIVE
Quinn (Tutor)_UCSB_2,s10,the left has a (negative on yours?) slope  which is numerically equal to D4,QUESTION
Quinn (Tutor)_UCSB_2,S01,but we need to answer the question #1,
Quinn (Tutor)_UCSB_2,s10,Since the beam is clamped at both ends  there are constraints on the slope and displacement at both ends  and no constraints in the middle,EXPLANATION_CONTRIBUTION+PREDICTION_CONTRIBUTION
Quinn (Tutor)_UCSB_2,S01,left end rotates... and right end displaces vertically?,QUESTION
Quinn (Tutor)_UCSB_2,s10,both ends are constrained vertically and rotationally I think  on mine the right side is _defined_ to be zero displacement and zero rotation,EXPLANATION_CONTRIBUTION
Quinn (Tutor)_UCSB_2,S01,looking at the graphs,
Quinn (Tutor)_UCSB_2,S01,left end rotates,
Quinn (Tutor)_UCSB_2,S01,right end moves vertically,PREDICTION_CONTRIBUTION
Quinn (Tutor)_UCSB_2,S01,ok move on?,AFFIRMATIVE+QUESTION+PREDICTION_CONTRIBUTION
Quinn (Tutor)_UCSB_2,s10,k,
Quinn (Tutor)_UCSB_2,S01,#2,
Quinn (Tutor)_UCSB_2,S01,do u know the relationship?,QUESTION
Quinn (Tutor)_UCSB_2,S01,o_o,
Quinn (Tutor)_UCSB_2,s10,well 1) k=M/(EI)    2) dθ/dx=k      3)dv/dx=θ,
Quinn (Tutor)_UCSB_2,s10,Think that answers it,
Quinn (Tutor)_UCSB_2,s10,so #3,
Quinn (Tutor)_UCSB_2,S01,is similar right?,QUESTION
Quinn (Tutor)_UCSB_2,S01,cuz they are just opposite direction,EXPLANATION_CONTRIBUTION+IDEA_CONTRIBUTION
Quinn (Tutor)_UCSB_2,s10,yes exactly what I'm putting down,AFFIRMATIVE+QUESTION+PREDICTION_CONTRIBUTION
Quinn (Tutor)_UCSB_2,s10,for a),
Quinn (Tutor)_UCSB_2,S01,k b,
Quinn (Tutor)_UCSB_2,S01,do we just look at those graphs <<<<<<<,
Quinn (Tutor)_UCSB_2,S01,?,QUESTION
Quinn (Tutor)_UCSB_2,s10,yes maximum stress is where there is the greatest slope over there <--  or the greatest curvature on the displacement chart,AFFIRMATIVE
Quinn (Tutor)_UCSB_2,s10,so for me  at x=9.33,
Quinn (Tutor)_UCSB_2,S01,so 20?,QUESTION
Quinn (Tutor)_UCSB_2,S01,did u calculated?,QUESTION
Quinn (Tutor)_UCSB_2,s10,should be like 10,
Quinn (Tutor)_UCSB_2,s10,the most extreme value in col H,PREDICTION_CONTRIBUTION
Quinn (Tutor)_UCSB_2,s10,is the point of max curvature,
Quinn (Tutor)_UCSB_2,S01,what does extreme value mean? the greatest?,QUESTION
Quinn (Tutor)_UCSB_2,S01,alright move on,AFFIRMATIVE+PREDICTION_CONTRIBUTION
Quinn (Tutor)_UCSB_2,s10,yes  greatest on your chart  but mine is the smallest negative value,AFFIRMATIVE+PREDICTION_CONTRIBUTION
Quinn (Tutor)_UCSB_2,S01,#4,
Quinn (Tutor)_UCSB_2,s10,we need to have each other's data written down,PREDICTION_CONTRIBUTION

Quinn (Tutor)_UCSB_2,s10,which formula?,QUESTION
Quinn (Tutor)_UCSB_2,S01,the formula we need to calculate the bending stress,FIRST_NAME
Quinn (Tutor)_UCSB_2,s10,On 3)c) I stated that σ=-Eky means that maximum absolute value stress  coincides with maximum absolute value curvature(freakin greek letters),
Quinn (Tutor)_UCSB_2,S01,oh,
Quinn (Tutor)_UCSB_2,S01,so just plug into that uation -Eky?,QUESTION+PREDICTION_CONTRIBUTION
Quinn (Tutor)_UCSB_2,S01,what is k and y?,QUESTION
Quinn (Tutor)_UCSB_2,s10,Can also use this formula for 4)  I think we can assume y=h/2  that's how our homeworks have been,EXPLANATION_CONTRIBUTION+IDEA_CONTRIBUTION
Quinn (Tutor)_UCSB_2,S01,I thought My/I,EXPLANATION_CONTRIBUTION+IDEA_CONTRIBUTION
Quinn (Tutor)_UCSB_2,S01,what is K? then,QUESTION
Quinn (Tutor)_UCSB_2,s10,That is true  but we are given a value for k  and not for M  so mine is simpler,AFFIRMATIVE
Quinn (Tutor)_UCSB_2,s10,kappa  curvature,
Quinn (Tutor)_UCSB_2,S01,where do u find k?,QUESTION
Quinn (Tutor)_UCSB_2,s10,in the excel sheet  col H,PREDICTION_CONTRIBUTION
