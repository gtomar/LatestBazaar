Quinn (Tutor)_UCSB_1,s13,Hello!,
Quinn (Tutor)_UCSB_1,s13,Nice to meet you Quinn,
Quinn (Tutor)_UCSB_1,S06,Hey!,
Quinn (Tutor)_UCSB_1,s13,Im working on getting the PDFs up  hold on,GIVING_NAME+PREDICTION_CONTRIBUTION
Quinn (Tutor)_UCSB_1,S06,Okay  I'm having issues with the links  once I get those figured out I can start talking...,AFFIRMATIVE+PREDICTION_CONTRIBUTION
Quinn (Tutor)_UCSB_1,s13,You have to type them into your browser yourself  6,PREDICTION_CONTRIBUTION
Quinn (Tutor)_UCSB_1,s13,ok  thanks,AFFIRMATIVE
Quinn (Tutor)_UCSB_1,s13,6 did you get the PDFs up?,QUESTION+PREDICTION_CONTRIBUTION
Quinn (Tutor)_UCSB_1,S06,Yep,AFFIRMATIVE
Quinn (Tutor)_UCSB_1,s13,so it looks like for part one we just need to print out the graphs that are filled out when we copy/paste the data yeah?,AFFIRMATIVE+QUESTION+PREDICTION_CONTRIBUTION
Quinn (Tutor)_UCSB_1,S06,Yeah  seemed pretty simple,AFFIRMATIVE
Quinn (Tutor)_UCSB_1,s13,just making sure im not missing anything huge here,GIVING_NAME+AFFIRMATIVE
Quinn (Tutor)_UCSB_1,S06,Okay  clarification  the graph is a measure of out of plane displacement  but the problem refers to the pieces moving up and down to stretch the material. ,AFFIRMATIVE+PREDICTION_CONTRIBUTION
Quinn (Tutor)_UCSB_1,S06,When part 2 ask for vertical displacement  it's referring to the out of plane displacement  correct?,QUESTION+PREDICTION_CONTRIBUTION
Quinn (Tutor)_UCSB_1,s13,I think so,EXPLANATION_CONTRIBUTION
Quinn (Tutor)_UCSB_1,s13,Although i dont think "stretched" is the right word... i think the specimen is being compressed no?,EXPLANATION_CONTRIBUTION+QUESTION
Quinn (Tutor)_UCSB_1,S06,I was pretty sure it was being stretched. ,AFFIRMATIVE
Quinn (Tutor)_UCSB_1,S06,Originally the bottom part with grippers "compresses" to latch on to the bottom of the specimen  but then it pulls away,
Quinn (Tutor)_UCSB_1,S06,Otherwise there would be no need for grippers  the two outside pieces could just push together with no need to grip on,PREDICTION_CONTRIBUTION
Quinn (Tutor)_UCSB_1,s13,truth,
Quinn (Tutor)_UCSB_1,s13,what i dont understand is why the displacement seems to go up or down  thes switch directions at around 10 microns,QUESTION+PREDICTION_CONTRIBUTION
Quinn (Tutor)_UCSB_1,S06,That's a good point. ,
Quinn (Tutor)_UCSB_1,S06,That's the fixed end that',
Quinn (Tutor)_UCSB_1,S06,s being pulled away  so maybe it has to do with the deformation of the specimen right there,IDEA_CONTRIBUTION
Quinn (Tutor)_UCSB_1,S06,?,QUESTION
Quinn (Tutor)_UCSB_1,S06,I feel like I've seen materials work that way in real life  but I don't know how to justify it,EXPLANATION_CONTRIBUTION+IDEA_CONTRIBUTION+PREDICTION_CONTRIBUTION
Quinn (Tutor)_UCSB_1,s13,I think that we're overthinking the graph. Its obviously real data  so it must work that way haha,EXPLANATION_CONTRIBUTION+IDEA_CONTRIBUTION
Quinn (Tutor)_UCSB_1,S06,haha okay. The question asks which side faces rotation  and if the fixed end isn't perfectly aligned  it would cause rotation in that end,AFFIRMATIVE+EXPLANATION_CONTRIBUTION+PREDICTION_CONTRIBUTION
Quinn (Tutor)_UCSB_1,s13,Id say both ends are rotating  and just the x=0 end is being displaced vertically,
Quinn (Tutor)_UCSB_1,S06,Definitely. I misread and thought it could only be one or the other,EXPLANATION_CONTRIBUTION+IDEA_CONTRIBUTION
Quinn (Tutor)_UCSB_1,s13,they really should have given us this introduction in advance so we didnt have to waste time figureing out whats going on here,QUESTION+PREDICTION_CONTRIBUTION
Quinn (Tutor)_UCSB_1,S06,True story. ,
Quinn (Tutor)_UCSB_1,S06,For part 2  it's just the equations we've gone over in class right?,QUESTION+PREDICTION_CONTRIBUTION
Quinn (Tutor)_UCSB_1,S06,EIV ' ' = M,
Quinn (Tutor)_UCSB_1,S06,which is the curvature,
Quinn (Tutor)_UCSB_1,s13,Yes,AFFIRMATIVE
Quinn (Tutor)_UCSB_1,s13,Are you typing this assignment or are you hand writing it?,QUESTION
Quinn (Tutor)_UCSB_1,S06,I think I'll probably handwrite it for the sake of being able to write theta and all that,EXPLANATION_CONTRIBUTION
Quinn (Tutor)_UCSB_1,S06,I've been scribbling down questions on paper so far,PREDICTION_CONTRIBUTION
Quinn (Tutor)_UCSB_1,s13,Ok,AFFIRMATIVE
Quinn (Tutor)_UCSB_1,S06,Crap  I forgot that we have two different specimens,
Quinn (Tutor)_UCSB_1,S06,Your graph is mostly a negative slop with a bump at 10 microns right?,QUESTION
Quinn (Tutor)_UCSB_1,S06,slope*,
Quinn (Tutor)_UCSB_1,s13,No I have a mostly positive slope,
Quinn (Tutor)_UCSB_1,s13,are you using Stress_poly4?,QUESTION
Quinn (Tutor)_UCSB_1,S06,No  I'm using stress_poly2 since we were supposed to have different ones,EXPLANATION_CONTRIBUTION
Quinn (Tutor)_UCSB_1,s13,Yeah thats what I thought...,AFFIRMATIVE+EXPLANATION_CONTRIBUTION+IDEA_CONTRIBUTION+QUESTION
Quinn (Tutor)_UCSB_1,s13,<-- more or less what my plot looks like,QUESTION+PREDICTION_CONTRIBUTION
Quinn (Tutor)_UCSB_1,S06,well that was pretty awful but that's mine,
Quinn (Tutor)_UCSB_1,S06,Sorry if I'm slowing you down  but basically we'll still have relatively the same max bending stress at about 8 microns then?,GIVING_NAME+EXPLANATION_CONTRIBUTION+QUESTION+PREDICTION_CONTRIBUTION
Quinn (Tutor)_UCSB_1,S06,Say what?,QUESTION
Quinn (Tutor)_UCSB_1,s13,Nobody is ben here.,GIVING_NAME
Quinn (Tutor)_UCSB_1,s13,yes I think so,AFFIRMATIVE+EXPLANATION_CONTRIBUTION
Quinn (Tutor)_UCSB_1,s13,Have you started number 4?,QUESTION
Quinn (Tutor)_UCSB_1,S06,Yes,AFFIRMATIVE
Quinn (Tutor)_UCSB_1,s13,Are you just using {Sigma} = -EKy?,QUESTION
Quinn (Tutor)_UCSB_1,s13,Seems almost too simple...,
Quinn (Tutor)_UCSB_1,S06,Yeah. And yeah it does. I think I've reread all this like 5 times because it seems almost too obvious,AFFIRMATIVE+EXPLANATION_CONTRIBUTION+IDEA_CONTRIBUTION
Quinn (Tutor)_UCSB_1,s13,Why would they include the width of the specimen if it isn't used...?,EXPLANATION_CONTRIBUTION+QUESTION+PREDICTION_CONTRIBUTION
Quinn (Tutor)_UCSB_1,S06,I was just wondering why. I mean I don't know why we would have to use the area at all.,
Quinn (Tutor)_UCSB_1,S06,Which is what it seems like with the base and height,QUESTION
Quinn (Tutor)_UCSB_1,S06,But considering we're only supposed to use one value from Excel  that's got to be it,
Quinn (Tutor)_UCSB_1,s13,It would make sense if we had to calculate the Moment of Inertia...,EXPLANATION_CONTRIBUTION+IDEA_CONTRIBUTION+PREDICTION_CONTRIBUTION
Quinn (Tutor)_UCSB_1,s13,...but we dont,
Quinn (Tutor)_UCSB_1,S06,Yeah  I think using sigma--KEy is fine,AFFIRMATIVE+EXPLANATION_CONTRIBUTION
Quinn (Tutor)_UCSB_1,S06,=-KEy*,
Quinn (Tutor)_UCSB_1,s13,ok. y=.5(2.25),AFFIRMATIVE
Quinn (Tutor)_UCSB_1,s13,right?,QUESTION
Quinn (Tutor)_UCSB_1,S06,Hmmm  let me look that up really quickly. ,PREDICTION_CONTRIBUTION
Quinn (Tutor)_UCSB_1,s13,it must be... in our example problems it looks like y is the distance from the neutral axis to the outer edge,PREDICTION_CONTRIBUTION
Quinn (Tutor)_UCSB_1,S06,Yes  duh  I saw that I beam picture we did in class,AFFIRMATIVE+PREDICTION_CONTRIBUTION
Quinn (Tutor)_UCSB_1,S06,so yeah  y=0.5*2.25,AFFIRMATIVE
Quinn (Tutor)_UCSB_1,s13,giga is 10^9 yeha?,AFFIRMATIVE+QUESTION
Quinn (Tutor)_UCSB_1,S06,yup,AFFIRMATIVE
Quinn (Tutor)_UCSB_1,s13,what was your max K btw?,QUESTION
Quinn (Tutor)_UCSB_1,s13,i had .00353... microns,
Quinn (Tutor)_UCSB_1,s13,Peace  brother,
Quinn (Tutor)_UCSB_1,S06,Thanks  later!,
Quinn (Tutor)_UCSB_1,S06,I have 0.000957 as my max kappa,
Quinn (Tutor)_UCSB_1,S06,Nevermind. Since it's the magnitude of kappa  not actual value  my max should've been 0.001974,EXPLANATION_CONTRIBUTION
Quinn (Tutor)_UCSB_1,s13,What do you mean by magnitude?,QUESTION
Quinn (Tutor)_UCSB_1,S06,Absolute value. My "max" was technically positive curvature at the very end of the slope  but it was a spike that doesn't really show up in the graph. ,PREDICTION_CONTRIBUTION
Quinn (Tutor)_UCSB_1,S06,The graph is a tighter curve around 8 microns  not at the end of the graph  about x=93 microns,
Quinn (Tutor)_UCSB_1,s13,Yeah my max occurs at 12.444 microns,AFFIRMATIVE
Quinn (Tutor)_UCSB_1,S06,Okay not too far off then  I think since the problem specifies it's brittle and has to be tested a lot that's probably an acceptable difference,AFFIRMATIVE+EXPLANATION_CONTRIBUTION
Quinn (Tutor)_UCSB_1,S06,All in all I got sigma=364.203  which is insignificant compared to the 2.2 GPa,PREDICTION_CONTRIBUTION
Quinn (Tutor)_UCSB_1,S06,That's also a ridiculously low number though,PREDICTION_CONTRIBUTION
Quinn (Tutor)_UCSB_1,s13,wait 364 Pa?,QUESTION
Quinn (Tutor)_UCSB_1,S06,yeah  I don't know whats going on  I'll look through again,AFFIRMATIVE+QUESTION
Quinn (Tutor)_UCSB_1,s13,I got .6524 microPascals,
Quinn (Tutor)_UCSB_1,s13,...,
Quinn (Tutor)_UCSB_1,S06,wowza...,
Quinn (Tutor)_UCSB_1,s13,It makes sense though  E is 10^9  K is 10^-6  and y is 10^-6,EXPLANATION_CONTRIBUTION
Quinn (Tutor)_UCSB_1,S06,if it's just sigma=-Eky  I'm plugging in E=164*10^9    k_max=0.001974     y=0.5*(2.25*10^-6),EXPLANATION_CONTRIBUTION+PREDICTION_CONTRIBUTION
Quinn (Tutor)_UCSB_1,s13,seems like the order of magnitude is correct,
Quinn (Tutor)_UCSB_1,S06,OOPS! I forgot the exponent for k,
Quinn (Tutor)_UCSB_1,S06,which puts me at 0.364 mPA,
Quinn (Tutor)_UCSB_1,s13,milli or micro?,QUESTION
Quinn (Tutor)_UCSB_1,S06,milli - that's 10^-3 right,
Quinn (Tutor)_UCSB_1,S06,EFF,
Quinn (Tutor)_UCSB_1,S06,NO Micro,
Quinn (Tutor)_UCSB_1,s13,nononono,
Quinn (Tutor)_UCSB_1,S06,Sorry I'm making dumb mistakes,
Quinn (Tutor)_UCSB_1,s13,youre right,
Quinn (Tutor)_UCSB_1,s13,i got milli pascals too,
Quinn (Tutor)_UCSB_1,s13,i misspoke,
Quinn (Tutor)_UCSB_1,S06,Okay haha final answer : 364 * 10^-6 Pa,AFFIRMATIVE
Quinn (Tutor)_UCSB_1,S06,so 0.364 milli Pa or 364 micro Pa,
Quinn (Tutor)_UCSB_1,s13,yeha,AFFIRMATIVE
Quinn (Tutor)_UCSB_1,s13,i got .6524 mPa,
Quinn (Tutor)_UCSB_1,s13,i think we both have to write both answers down,EXPLANATION_CONTRIBUTION+PREDICTION_CONTRIBUTION
Quinn (Tutor)_UCSB_1,S06,yep,AFFIRMATIVE
Quinn (Tutor)_UCSB_1,S06,So that's it then? ,QUESTION
Quinn (Tutor)_UCSB_1,s13,i guess so,
Quinn (Tutor)_UCSB_1,s13,i mean the answer to number 5 is obviously "insignificant",
Quinn (Tutor)_UCSB_1,S06,Yeah  definitely. I know it's supposed to be brittle but that's such a small stress,AFFIRMATIVE+PREDICTION_CONTRIBUTION
Quinn (Tutor)_UCSB_1,s13,Well  that was a huge waste of time.,
Quinn (Tutor)_UCSB_1,s13,Free extra Credit I guess,
Quinn (Tutor)_UCSB_1,S06,Haha tell me about it.,
Quinn (Tutor)_UCSB_1,s13,Whats your name  btw?,QUESTION
Quinn (Tutor)_UCSB_1,S06,I'm Shelby Hallford,GIVING_NAME

Quinn (Tutor)_UCSB_1,s13,I think Quinn is actually a malfunctioning program,EXPLANATION_CONTRIBUTION
Quinn (Tutor)_UCSB_1,S06,HAHAHA,
Quinn (Tutor)_UCSB_1,S06,At least he's enthusiastic,
Quinn (Tutor)_UCSB_1,s13,I guess thats what happens when you become a grad student...?,QUESTION
Quinn (Tutor)_UCSB_1,s13,hahah,
Quinn (Tutor)_UCSB_1,S06,haha Maybe  I guess I'll savor my time left here,IDEA_CONTRIBUTION
Quinn (Tutor)_UCSB_1,S06,I gotta get to work  sorry if you missed class Adam  see you tomorrow,GIVING_NAME+EXPLANATION_CONTRIBUTION
