in diffusion, molecules move from higher concentration areas to lower concentration areas
the water and the glucose will try to balance out
the inside and outside will move toward equilibrium
the constant movement of molecules leads the system toward balance
molecules are always moving randomly
molecules keep on moving even after equilibrium is reached
the starch molecules are too big to pass through the membrane
the membrane is selectively permeable to glucose, but not to starch
the membrane is selectively permeable
the membrane is permeable to glucose and water
the membrane is permeable to water
the membrane is permeable to iodine
the membrane is not permeable to starch
iodine can be used to detect the presence of starch
when iodine and starch mix, they turn purple
iodine turns purple when starch is there
starch molecules are too big to pass through the membrane
starch molecules are more complex than glucose molecules
glucose molecules are small enough to pass through the membrane
iodine molecules can pass through the membrane
water molecules can pass through the membrane
if water enters the cell, it gains weight
if water leaves the cell, it loses weight
the tube gets heavier if water flows in but not out
the tube gets lighter if water flows out but not in
a glucose test strip changes color when glucose is there
a glucose test strip changes from yellow to green when glucose is there
the glucose strip and the iodine are both used as indicators
the membrane keeps the starch concentration from changing much
the size of the membrane pores regulates the concentration of starch
the starch won't pass through the membrane
equilibrium is maintained by diffusion
the membrane is permeable to iodine and water
things go from higher concentration to lower concentration when they can
the cell won't let big molecules pass through
the membrane is not permeable to complex molecules
indicators can prove that there was a change in concentration 
glucose will make the indicator strip darker
starch will make the iodine darker
the glucose can pass through the cell membrane
the cell membrane is permeable to glucose
the cell membrane will not let starch pass through
molecules will move to the area of lower concentration if they can
water is able to get in but the starch isn't be able to diffuse out
both water and glucose molecules are able to move between the two environments
the weight of the tube increased
the weight was observed to increase
the molecules diffused through the membrane
