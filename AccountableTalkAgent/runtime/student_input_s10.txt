s058 yes
who is challenger
?
Me
ya leave people alone
who care
how rude
common guys
i did not type yene
discuss abt this topic
yup same to u alex

ok thanks {s064}
.and help
do u have any questions?
yes what is c!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
For what hour!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
1-5
It loses weight and color sir thank you
who is S063
numbers please
I predict that in Condition A the cell model would gain more water and Codition b would loose the water in the cell model
IM {s060}!!!:)
im {s063}
I think it is going to get heavier
WHO IS IN MY GROUPP??
{s057} who is in my group
Wait I'm confusedd please explain this again
the egg will get bigger
heavier
i agree with s057
i cant understand.
wait so it's me,{s063},and {s057}?? why are we talking about eggs?
oo ok. i got it
this guy is smart
he may be smart but I am lost!!!
YO ALEX HELP ME OUT HERE!!!

idk either!!!!!!
aww poop!

Hey
who is this
62 is {s062}
who is {s062}
it is goin 2 get heavier
kid in the grey hood
okay now what do we do?
somthing about the egg
okay i am about to ask them for more information on this
m
mm
mmm
mmmmm
mmmmmmmmmmmmm
mmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm
mmmmmmmmmmmmmmm
would you stop saying the same thing ovae and over omqq
yyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy
i think were suppose to work on our prediction
maybe
umm a you can say that when you mix them together the colors will change and something may happen..okay
maybe
wacth the video
okay so do you want to put that down
who is this anyway
{s059}...and we can say when you mix them together the color changes and they have different weight
glucose will dissolve in the distilled water
put in what box
predicted change
umm or you going to say somthinq back
thanks
iin thee ontha box ii put when they are put together they will dissolve in the distilled water....okay
{s059} guess who this is
byee
awww
come on
for explanation for prediction box it is we cant see glucose once it goes into water
who is s062
{s062}
hey buddy
whos 56
put iin thee otha box they dunt dissolve in thee water...
who iis 56
have u heaard about the word
who iis 56
y u wanna kno
bjus yuee are twalkinq tew me
i will give u a hint im in ur class
i would never guessed
{s056}

what {s047}
haha
nope i left the room cuz i cut my finger on the chair
{s033}
what
you are supposedtoask mesomething
what do u think will happen to the glucose in the distilled water
{s047} you have no clue what we are doing
do u???
nope
i cant find the video toast!!!
on the desktop there is a folder videos
go there
you will findthe video
wait what is it called
combined video
but it wouldnt work before
thats y i asked which one it was
ohh
k
so what do you guys predict
idk my viseo still isnt working
well tht lady took my paper yinz guys lol
why did she take your paper
idk!
omg
so how are u going to work
idk
i watched the video and i have no idea what we ater supposed to do
well first we should makesome predictions
i wrote the wieght and color of the little strips
ohh
ok well cn sumbody write my name on their papaer bcuz mines is gone
{s047} please build on what {s040} is sayin haha
shut up cereal
lol
hahha
ewww ur doggy toast ha ha
did you guys writethe observations
i wrote what i could this is so weird
i dnt hav a paper i cnt
aaaaaaaaaaahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
the lady took it a while ago idk y
what is the observation for the third one?
well if ik wat it was id tell u but. . .no paper lol
u dont need a paper look at the video
ur killin me toast!
ok il look cereal
haaa
asdfjkl;
homerow keys
haha
lol ms pfifer tought u tht
ya
{s040} help me out here buddy what did u get for the third one

happy birthday {s040} form {s049}
o wait wat was the third 1
hahah
ok i am back with all the answers
i think
happy birthday!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!111
ok thanks
{s033}, what are you talking about
on third one predictions, or observations
observations
after what hour
one
ok .655 grams,color of the tube got darker
imma fail tht lil test
bye u guys
bye
me
too
{s047}
OMG!!!

hi alex
hi 32 and 46
im {s039}
hi i am {s039}
hi im {s046}
hi {s046}
hey {s053}
hey {s053} from {s032}
32 is {s032}
39 is {s039}
hi {s039}
so u know
hi {s032}
so what do you think about the first one {s039}
i dont know i feel stupid do you know {s046}?
i think water wil be taken out of the cell because the glucose will harvest the water
i was going to ask but ok thats sounds right
yea alex
who's in my group?
hahahahha {s046}
{s046} is mean from {s039}
your beat
no she is super beat
exactly
okay so what are we doing?
for solution a i think water will be added to the cell
my explanation is that the glucose will absorb the water causing the cell to expand
i think the exact opposite
why?
lets go to the video
to my knowledge glucose attractes water but when inside an ienvoronment itll push out water but i could be wrong
so i like what you siad
said
alrite what do you think about condition B?
i didnt watch it yet
i think the cell would lose weigtt to because the glucose will extract the water out of the cell
so it turns out i was right according to the video the cell in (a) gained wight and the one in (b) loses wight
:)
byeee(:
yea thats what i was thinking {s032}
i need helpp
i saw the video condition b will take water out
so my prediction was right from the start
yea
condition a is right also.
so {s039} what you doing saturday nght
i didnt see the video for condition a though
jk
idk
ok
hat was weird
that
he says idk hahhahah {s033} says hi
never do that again
tell i {s033} i say nothing
awe thats mean
no its not
im gonna watch the video to see condition c
okay
im gonna watch it too to understand whats going on
fun fact from dr {s032} asdfjkl; are all home row keys
fun fact from doctor {s032} you can type the word typewriter using only the top row
lol
also for "C" the starch will come out slowlyu
slowly
fun fact lollipop is the longest word you can type using only your left hand
my explanation is the water will "absorb" the starch causing the cell to decrease
{s032} its ur right hand
oh hahahah i meant to say that swear any way

hi my name is {s038}
hi my name is {s031}
{s045}
what do you think will hlappen?
i think that a and b will turn out the same.
i think in condition A water will go inside the cell and b will be the oppisite
what do you think will happpen?
ok..sound about right
what wil happen to condition c./
/
?
i dont knooww,
:?
i have no idea either
alrighhttm
ok.
what the explanatiion for what you guys said?
what do you mean ?
idk
great help..
it says whats the explanation for your prediction
for A i said that water would go inside since gloucuse dissolves in waterr and the membrane would gain weight
im not sure though
that sounds gooood.
ok..what did you put for condition B
LETS WATCH THE VIDEO IN THE OTHER TAB..
ok
ok
COUGH COUGH at the bottomof the page
hahhaha
waht did you put for conditon c?
the thing {s031} said?\
i think for c that it would turn purple since the starch would mix with the idione or is it the other way around
i was thinking the same thing
i dont know what this video is doing i cant hear anything and its confusing me
same here..i cant see the weighto=or anythign
exactly,
i dont know how to do any of thiss.
i got the weight but i can barely see the strips
for a and b the strips are dark green
yeaah, i got alll confused and dont know is for which
whats the weight
condtion A
wasnt one like .60
1: .620
after 1 hr?
ya
and then after 5 hours it was .635
and after 1 day it was .630
for b it was .540 for 1 hour
.525 for 5 hours
what was the weight for conditon b?
and then .525 again for a day
thankk youu
ok..whaty about for conditon c?
i didnt get there yet in the videeooo
neither did i...what did you put for your observations for a and b
?
for c after i hour it was black on the tube and the water outside look kinda yellow and it was .655
after 5 hours?
after 5 hours it was .655 and the water still looked yellow
and then after 24 hours it was .635
ok and for one day?
and the water looked lighter than for before
okkaaaaayyyy. do you guys know why this stuff happpned
for a....it gained weight because th glucose was obsorbed
okay and then would it be the oppistie for b
?
umm...im not so sure
iit lost weighht
nevermind....yeah it would
okay
what about for c?
soooo it lost water from inside?
yeah..weight was lost because the glucose didnt absord all the way
what would we put for c
and the last one lost weight
idk this quiz :(
mmee either

{s037}
this is {s037}
{s044}
ur mom
hi {s036[sic]}
mmmhm
im watching you
haha..were gona fail
what do we do
write your preditions
whos this
{s030}
m j :)
fag
watch the videio..and that wasnt me..ha
8=====>
V
MJ
{s036} gay
{s045} wrote all that
did you guys get it
i got it
wat did u observe for 5hrs condition c
i love you
i hate {s036}
condition gained waight'
(a)
(b)
lost waight'
yep
c gained weight for hr and 5 hrs then lost weight at day
i didnt watch c
same
o
tell {so36} shes a hoe
she said your momma mj!
how much does (c) weigh on th first hr
and the 5th hr
and after day one
6.55 for both
.655 srry
thx
thats wat she said
wow..lol

HELLO?
hi
{s029[pet name form]}
ooooo
what do we discuss
{s029}!
haha hey boyfriend!
WHAT ARE WE SUPPOSED TO WRITE
for A?
wouldn't that be the same for B?
i think the glucose will dissolve
how do you know there's more glucose than water outside than inside?
wait what're we writing for the explanation for each prediction? so far i just have "water will mix with glucose to try to balance out the water molecules" for the predicted change for A
what's the predicted change for B?
noooo!!! i need B and the Explanation for Prediction of each one
wait, would osmosis be the explanation for A?
so we're writing "Osmosis" in the box for Explanation?!
hahahh oh dear
i only watched a couple seconds of the video so far
at the bottom, next to start it says "combined video"
for the explantion for C i put "stach absorbs liquid and water is a liquid"
me too!
hi
this is {s036} :)
HELLO!? who is there
hi :D
your mom... {s036} :)
who are you?^
who is 29
{s043} wat are we doing?
BOYFRIEND! :)
ok wat r we doin?
a? i thought it was #1?
for predicted change?
i need help! ;(
ok can someone help me please!
for A what did we get for the explanation for prediction.. since i need alot of help!
wait {s029} did you watch the video already?
no no no ! i need the A & C prediction.....
okayy thankyouu :) now we watch the video?
b- water will obsorbed bc there is more gluecose/ the water travel low water level to a higher source? ritght?
yeah the A "the water will go into the tube bc of osmois"
idk this is wat she was sayn
but she is watching the video we are soo lost :(
i put for A the explantation prediction of what i said about A lol!
WHERE IS THE VIDEO!?
i hate psp :'( idk wats goin on
yea i put like the same thing " water will go into the strarch"
well im going to watch the video lol
who is my partner
who is so29
who is dis wats a {s029[pet name form]}
dis is {s043}
i think the water will travel into the tube with the gluecose because of osmosis
water will mix with the gluecose to try and balance out the water molecules
yes for a
i think the water will be obsorbed
for part b
there is more gluecose than water outside than inside so the water will come out
becasue the tube of water is siting inside the container of gluecose
yea dats right for b i jus said the water will b obsorbed because there is more gluecose and the water will travel from a low water level to attempt to go to a higher source of water
is everybody redy for the video?????
a-the water will go into the tube because of osmosis
c-the water will go into the starch
b-i think the water will be obsorbed
{s028}!
i am so confused
thankyou! i have nothing written on my paper, i'm a bit stupid
no alex, we arent! jeeze!
alright, i am still on A, for the first box thing
what do you guys think?
yeah, i think we should
down at the bottom of the screen
i think that for C, the predicted change would be that the water will move into the starch
wooo now all i need is B! and the entire second box haha
wouldnt for B, the water will once again shrink because its mixing water with glucose again?
oh ok, or your prediction haha
yeah
that makes sense
wouldnt the explanation for C be that starch absorbs water, and thats why the water will move into it?
mkkk. now all we need is the explanation for box A
ok, now we have to watch that stupid video, but didnt he tell us to X out of it?
mk me too
we didnt even take the quiz yet, and i failed hahhaha
bye guys!
hi, my name is {s035}
ook....so we got the parts.. who else is in the group...and i have no clue what we are doing.... do we just talk about what we think is going to happen to the egg
who is s028
oo hey im {s035}!!
ook group what do we pedict
ook this is what i think...if we put the cell model in the water it will grow like the egg did....but if its in teh sugar it will shrink
im with {s028} on this one....
haha its cool and {s042} that is a good idea.... i think we mite have to watch the movie
we need to watch the movie maybe??
ook were do we go lol
thnx found it
i still hav eno clue what to write in all the boxes :(
i think we ahuld all write what we think an dthen talk about it
are we on the first set of boxes of the seconf??
ok thnx...for the second st of boxes for the observations change i put all the weights i saw in the movie
oo great a quiz
bye
W ho's 35?
O h this is {s042}
Yeah. I think that water will try to even out with glucose for the first one
I think that the water will seperate and travel to glucose. Because water has a lot of molecules and glucose is just sugar. So it would then balance out. What do you think?
Oh I get it. But wouldn't it still expand and try to balance out?
It's like Osmosis I think. If it's water mixed in with sugar like liquid or another solvent it will try to balance out. Like salt. Does that help?
I think that it might balance out and that {s035}'s right with the shrinking of the water.
Yeah we should
So far it's like consuing and growing
The glucose weighed it down and then disperssed
I agree with s028
Okay, I think that when the distilled water is put into the glucose the glucose will get lighter and then well I don't know what then.....
Oh I think it would, but it might expand at first then shrink
the explanation I think would be that since when h20 is put into another solvent it expands its molecules and then maybe it would shrink from the glucose
Yeah thats what shoud happen for the starch box
Kay
Box A I think would be that there's a lot of water and glucose is sugar so it would shrink and like balance
First
I'm restarting the video the 2nd box is confusing....
I don't want a quiz
I think the glocos will get heavier
bye bye
{s027}
034, would you like to build on to what 041 is saying? and me too!
who is 34?
ooh. hi
idk what to do.
i think it will turn a different color.
{s041}?
in your own words
?!?!?!
ur one to talk!!!
kk
just write what she[{s034}] said.
ok, but where do i click to watch it?
nevermind i found it.
{s034} are these #'s all of the predictions or explanations?
{s034}?
#3, is that the prediction?
idk.
ikr.
this is so stupid.
yep yep
do what?
our tutor left us!!!
she is a baad tutor!!!
really? haah! oh well. idc. he/she/it
i ddnt even watch the whole video
do you know what happened?
oh. what was it after 1 hour for condition A?
{s041}, did you get everything so far?
k, i'll fast forward and try to find the last one, when im done writing the condition b.
lol
i sd i'd try to find it if i could.
aaah there is a quiz!!!!!!!!!!!!!
im gonna fail!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
is it ur birthday?
...
bye bye guys.
my name is {s034}
what do you think'ds going to happen?
im so confused!
{s034}
someone predict something
oh i get it! what do you think is going to happen when you put the glucose in the distilled water?
the answer to number one : the distilled water will move into the internal envorment of glucose solution
and the explaination is glucose is denser
#2 the distilled water will move into the external enviroment
watch the video
#3 the water will move into the starch because starch absorbs it
yeaaaa
its both, the first part is the prediction the second part is the explanation
i want to shoot myself in the foot -.-
this would be so much easier just in a group
D:
im pretty sure its a he
i watched most of it
i just wrote the observations
condition a: 620 glucose inside; 635 glucose inside; 630 glucose inside; explanation: the membrane will hold stuff for a certain amount of time
condition b: 540 glucose outside; 525 glucose outside; 525 glucose outside; explanation: the glucose was not being absorbed by the water
i think .
yea, sure i do, whatever. hahahahahha
i dont even think there was one
HAPPY BIRTHDAAAY {s041} :D :D :D :D :D :D :D :D :D
{s041}
who is 27
the world is going to end in 2012
THE WORLD IS GOING TO END IN 2012 !
ok dude what 27 said
you have to be more specific 27
huh?
for the explination
we have to do all the prediction , thats what NACHO said
what is explanation for #2
you dont have the balls to do it
you mean i know !
lol what is C
there is & ok
stfu !
lol thsnks
my name is {s020}
i think that the liquid inside will come out
{s021} why do you think that the glucose will stay inside
{s021}
i dont get this
i think that it will let water in but not glucose
i disagree with {s020} because i really dont understand what she just said
what does that mean s022
hi im {s022}
i think that the glucose and distilled water will mix
what does what mean?
hi every1
hi
whos this
{s004}
stop typinh all fazt
{s004}
the glucsoe will expand in side. becasue of the sugar attracts?
? concur

mk {s008/Alex}<3
do you like spongebob
{s008/Alex}?
<333333333
um tyhay it loses weight
it loses weight
right?
nope wer watching iyt
who is this
{s008} n whois this
oh r u sittin next to {s009}??
idk who {s012} is
oh ok and hi {s004}
typin wat the yellow stuff is the tutor all the other color stuff is us
idek wat we r doin
oh yess i agree
i hope you know wat u r doig
doing*****
alrighty then
yess i love spongebob<3
no i prefer not
i said it will gain weight #2 will lose weight and #3 stays the same
watever
does ne one know wat they r doing
ok this video made no sense at all soes any one know what they are doing
well then tell me
well then tell me
well i only got the 1 hour thing nd the 5 hour one i dint watch the rest of the video
{s004} are u still on
ok tht is good i love how u just say tht randomly
alright we r cheatin on this quiz wats the answers
sup
its {s012} whos this?
im {s012}
and yes
its the tutor typein that
whos 004?
oh ok sup
smartness
i concur
with what?
i LOVE spongebob
o yes.jk
ok so what are we putting for A?
can we get off the subject of spongebob?
wtf?
ok so what u put for A?
ok
yeah i agreee
it will lose weight because water has no glucose in it and the glucose will let out sugar
#2 it will gain weight
maybeee
well A is retarded
it gained twice then lost weight
she got shot
hello this is christian
who r u guys
i cannot build on
so for glucose we are putting the cell gets smaller? why?
is anyone in here
who is #11 and #7
{s003} lol
wow
i didnt get anything
is alex a real person or a computer
j jik\
it was they just told me
when we put in the glucose the cell will get smaller
the cell will blacken when it comes in touch with the iodine
we gotta watch a video
{s007}
this is so confusing
mhm
i said it was gonna lose weight for solution b
yeah he was & idk why
I'm {s011}
{s003} can you build on to what s007 said.
I dont understand this.
I'm {s011}, who are you
haha whos number 07
And stupid
For solution B what did we say for prediction and explanation
Same but i didnt say why. And I dotn know. I think he was a computer thing.
Why what?
{s002}
why isnt this working?
If glucose is placed in the beaker the water in the tube will disapear
for 1 hour on a it was .620 they were both clear tube and beaker and both strips were green
same for the B but the weight was .540
{s006}
this thing is slow
what one are you talking about
i see you
what was the explaination for C and A
never mind
is anyone else seriously confused
no i didnt write anything down for the observations
{s010}
ask
water will be able to get in but the starch wont be able to move out so the tube will expand
thats for C
C on the chart
i see you too
no
no
{s006}, did you get any other observation other than the weight
yes
nice
....
um bye?
