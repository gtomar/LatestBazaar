i	think	81
make	it	45
are	we	41
do	we	38
to	be	37
the	length	36
max	stress	35
the	same	35
yield	strength	35
on	the	35
the	cost	34
of	the	34
it	is	33
the	wrench	31
we	can	31
we	have	30
we	re	29
i	guess	28
it	would	28
to	use	28
in	the	26
is	the	26
should	be	26
we	should	26
factor	of	24
the	max	24
the	stress	23
to	the	23
so	we	22
how	do	22
are	you	22
have	to	21
think	we	20
if	we	19
stress	observed	19
would	be	19
for	the	18
going	to	18
allowed	stress	18
we	are	18
the	material	17
i	am	17
yield	stress	17
sounds	good	16
i	don	16
ok	so	16
we	need	16
change	the	16
we	want	15
to	make	15
i	dont	15
this	is	15
be	safe	14
would	break	14
the	volume	14
supposed	to	14
out	of	14
stress	is	14
max	allowed	14
the	handle	14
increase	the	14
safety	factor	14
of	course	14
the	maximum	13
i	was	13
can	we	13
so	what	13
need	to	13
do	you	13
with	the	13
is	too	12
what	are	12
do	it	12
i	thought	12
so	lets	12
to	get	12
got	it	12
it	was	12
but	it	12
a	good	12
want	to	12
is	it	12
make	the	11
easier	to	11
we	use	11
more	expensive	11
the	worksheet	11
maximum	stress	11
not	safe	11
for	design	11
steel	is	11
that	is	11
use	steel	11
ease	of	11
of	use	11
of	safety	11
more	stress	11
per	pound	11
lets	make	11
you	re	11
avis	is	11
we	just	10
the	safety	10
a	lot	10
if	it	10
the	moment	10
to	me	10
it	should	10
cost	per	10
it	easier	10
higher	moment	10
we	change	10
we	could	10
what	is	10
we	did	10
8	inches	10
lb	in	10
cost	of	10
it	to	10
to	do	10
to	steel	9
of	steel	9
yes	yes	9
so	it	9
should	we	9
which	is	9
use	aluminum	9
a	longer	9
we	doing	9
you	are	9
be	the	9
my	bad	9
length	of	9
i	ll	9
longer	wrench	9
is	that	9
slow	down	9
we	do	9
okay	so	9
the	design	9
titanium	is	9
think	it	9
with	aluminum	9
it	longer	8
i	see	8
it	safe	8
lets	try	8
length	for	8
you	can	8
lets	do	8
and	then	8
a	robot	8
go	with	8
t	think	8
s	the	8
get	the	8
i	just	8
so	that	8
i	cant	8
s	just	8
and	cost	8
how	long	8
higher	yield	8
think	so	8
its	not	8
will	be	8
we	were	8
wrench	is	8
you	avis	8
a	little	8
the	force	8
thank	you	7
for	steel	7
to	change	7
can	get	7
the	best	7
you	guys	7
with	steel	7
change	it	7
3	12	7
do	the	7
the	factor	7
it	out	7
good	to	7
lets	use	7
wrench	handle	7
my	name	7
lever	arm	7
where	do	7
out	the	7
what	do	7
the	last	7
observed	in	7
from	the	7
we	make	7
and	the	7
the	yield	7
does	it	7
we	got	7
12	inches	7
makes	it	7
we	get	7
do	that	7
what	the	7
less	stress	7
the	whiteboard	7
it	does	7
2	inches	7
made	of	6
how	much	6
is	doubled	6
aluminum	wrench	6
keep	the	6
just	double	6
how	about	6
in	pro	6
just	said	6
i	got	6
in	length	6
have	the	6
that	way	6
all	the	6
change	in	6
that	the	6
if	the	6
as	long	6
thats	what	6
guess	so	6
high	yield	6
what	about	6
that	would	6
tell	us	6
our	own	6
s	not	6
steel	and	6
how	did	6
max	length	6
using	aluminum	6
dont	know	6
yes	it	6
of	wrench	6
see	it	6
it	will	6
do	this	6
less	force	6
right	now	6
avis	what	6
i	have	6
volume	is	6
if	you	6
steel	or	6
calculate	the	6
then	it	6
so	the	6
for	aluminum	6
s	what	6
of	aluminum	6
length	by	6
goes	up	6
to	work	5
we	supposed	5
it	in	5
but	the	5
us	to	5
12	inch	5
i	mean	5
the	numbers	5
decrease	the	5
too	expensive	5
it	ll	5
me	too	5
aluminum	is	5
that	we	5
the	sheet	5
stress	to	5
how	to	5
is	going	5
as	the	5
thanks	avis	5
no	idea	5
use	the	5
weight	of	5
i	didn	5
but	that	5
is	safe	5
a	factor	5
length	and	5
still	using	5
t	know	5
on	our	5
yes	we	5
i	dunno	5
think	you	5
keep	it	5
as	well	5
no	it	5
think	its	5
t	we	5
yeah	that	5
to	aluminum	5
see	the	5
did	that	5
volume	of	5
avis	come	5
thought	we	5
the	other	5
back	to	5
a	wrench	5
wrench	that	5
think	avis	5
avis	are	5
hello	avis	5
i	agree	5
name	is	5
allowed	to	5
too	high	5
t	really	5
can	you	5
alright	so	5
i	hope	5
stress	of	5
i	can	5
good	job	5
a	computer	5
mr	program	5
stays	the	5
should	use	5
8750	6400	5
the	thickness	5
so	its	5
hi	avis	5
a	real	5
as	we	5
cross	sectional	5
we	calculate	5
to	go	5
we	ll	5
same	material	5
pretty	sure	5
is	not	5
and	make	4
i	feel	4
based	on	4
the	screen	4
see	what	4
or	just	4
i	know	4
yeild	strength	4
has	to	4
i	wish	4
much	more	4
guess	not	4
weight	and	4
the	bottom	4

come	on	4
so	is	4
how	are	4
15	000	4
who	wants	4
wants	to	4

hey	guys	4
why	does	4
and	weight	4
the	table	4
a	safety	4
by	the	4
no	wait	4
costs	more	4
the	new	4
cost	is	4
suppose	to	4
stress	will	4
oh	right	4
third	design	4
should	make	4
cost	more	4
aluminum	and	4
the	most	4
we	still	4
observed	stress	4
fill	in	4
for	me	4
is	more	4
what	material	4
im	pretty	4
in	proe	4
we	changed	4
go	avis	4

or	what	4
inches	it	4
lets	work	4
length	is	4
higher	yeild	4

come	back	4
just	use	4
gave	us	4
it	can	4

oh	ok	4
the	area	4

there	is	4
easy	to	4
it	just	4
you	want	4
of	stress	4
so	let	4
we	type	4
does	the	4
missing	an	4
move	on	4
increasing	the	4
go	on	4
an	aluminum	4
an	important	4
important	concept	4
stick	with	4
stress	means	4
and	change	4
with	it	4
real	person	4
yes	avis	4
avis	you	4
length	to	4
stress	makes	4
to	keep	4
its	the	4
increase	length	4
got	that	4
that	was	4
why	not	4
cmon	avis	4
stress	low	4
sectional	area	4
i	hate	4
sure	it	4
that	already	4
looks	good	4
i	suppose	4
is	this	4
it	breaks	4
long	as	4
dont	see	4
changed	the	4
up	to	4
cook	with	4
look	at	4
fair	enough	4
long	do	3
volume	and	3
pretty	much	3
then	we	3
i	did	3
wrench	would	3
m	not	3
not	sure	3
were	supposed	3
a	max	3
a	shorter	3
wait	what	3
say	it	3
a	higher	3
what	avis	3
and	it	3
no	its	3
lets	go	3
6	inches	3
up	on	3
so	who	3
this	wrench	3
so	you	3
lighter	and	3
handle	would	3
we	keep	3
you	need	3
seems	like	3
guy	up	3
up	front	3
we	gotta	3
yeah	we	3
force	and	3
and	area	3
greater	moment	3
us	about	3
what	now	3
t	it	3
stop	moving	3
think	the	3
it	though	3
i	believe	3
doing	the	3
now	we	3
the	calculations	3
longer	than	3
this	design	3
the	thing	3

this	thing	3
like	the	3

as	it	3
the	longer	3
would	have	3
whats	up	3
t	break	3

that	right	3
you	just	3
we	allowed	3
manufacturing	costs	3
stick	to	3
double	it	3
should	probably	3
it	shorter	3
u	get	3
work	backwards	3
s	up	3
was	right	3
where	are	3

everything	is	3
a	calculator	3

oh	okay	3
making	it	3
not	as	3

at	12	3
t	change	3
the	paper	3
just	do	3

we	even	3

you	at	3
filling	out	3
no	we	3
i	would	3
use	it	3
no	avis	3
t	do	3
which	means	3
means	we	3
stress	for	3
it	safer	3
strength	is	3
with	you	3
did	it	3
you	get	3
steel	one	3
use	titanium	3
it	takes	3
force	yes	3
could	be	3
they	gave	3
cost	effective	3
come	to	3
about	this	3
in	design	3
but	its	3
lb	in2	3
dont	think	3
can	change	3
that	makes	3
you	use	3
the	dimensions	3
sticking	with	3
and	we	3
for	cost	3
less	less	3
is	right	3
be	good	3
1	04	3
5	inches	3
to	us	3
is	our	3
is	stronger	3
but	we	3
because	the	3
ok	lets	3
numbers	in	3
cost	and	3
we	decided	3
doubling	the	3

thanks	for	3
increase	in	3
of	time	3
re	just	3
to	move	3
course	not	3
looking	for	3
have	no	3
right	on	3

to	have	3
yeild	stress	3
longer	arm	3
aluminum	still	3
see	how	3
8	21	3
makes	the	3
i	like	3
push	it	3
talking	to	3
the	computer	3
it	has	3
too	much	3
so	volume	3
is	looking	3
lot	more	3
the	longest	3
why	we	3
leave	us	3
i	need	3
you	mean	3
i	do	3
do	not	3
not	know	3
600	lb	3
know	how	3
the	one	3
get	to	3
a	material	3
than	aluminum	3
safe	is	3
you	sure	3
it	matter	3
to	8750	3
more	than	3
is	12	3
i	say	3
left	us	3
so	should	3
be	too	3
stronger	material	3
get	max	3
inch	wrench	3
avis	go	3
4	is	3
oh	no	3
hate	you	3
ideal	length	3
what	happened	3
design	three	3
wrench	we	3
lower	the	3
they	re	3

slightly	less	3
it	wont	3
is	still	3
to	cost	3
i	want	3
of	this	3
for	our	3
bye	avis	3
yea	but	3
nothing	to	3
do	with	3

changing	it	3
that	by	3
t	you	3
what	it	3
for	max	3
the	density	3
he	is	3

works	too	3
aluminum	for	3
0625	in	2
told	us	2

second	design	2
just	make	2
as	our	2
2	was	2
4	times	2
times	the	2
our	third	2
plastic	is	2
are	only	2
too	weak	2
im	behind	2
shall	we	2
since	it	2
assume	that	2
it	doesn	2
t	that	2
and	still	2
still	use	2
behind	you	2
the	3rd	2
i	had	2
maybe	we	2
not	it	2
r	we	2
looks	like	2
oh	really	2
it	isn	2
some	numbers	2
over	my	2
would	deform	2
a	safer	2
safer	material	2
re	going	2
material	used	2
gift	card	2
15000	lb	2
okay	lets	2
we	suppose	2
it	here	2
be	filling	2
filling	in	2
really	quick	2
until	the	2
type	this	2
this	up	2
ll	do	2
the	chat	2
maximize	the	2
s	gonna	2
gonna	do	2
is	exactly	2
way	to	2
is	allowed	2
down	on	2
x	14	2
who	is	2
we	calculating	2
safety	is	2
no	clue	2
right	it	2
it	down	2
calculating	maximum	2
steel	its	2
a	bigger	2
should	increase	2
or	the	2
i	will	2
is	so	2
or	we	2
this	in	2
or	not	2
it	cheaper	2
and	stronger	2
by	cost	2
calculating	the	2
hi	tutor	2
balance	between	2
filled	in	2
2	and	2
the	cheapest	2
larger	moment	2
and	they	2
program	is	2
about	it	2
seems	to	2
well	we	2
longer	is	2
could	make	2
its	safer	2
we	using	2
need	less	2
did	we	2
little	bit	2
of	both	2
had	to	2
so	just	2
by	50	2
is	higher	2
get	that	2
due	to	2
why	yes	2
you	do	2
were	doing	2
the	middle	2
doesnt	make	2
percent	increase	2
a	summary	2
you	go	2
handle	that	2
what	to	2
the	summary	2
m	ashley	2
a	text	2
just	keep	2
right	but	2
what	other	2
with	higher	2
because	its	2
that	costs	2
it	costs	2
we	try	2
to	moment	2
steel	because	2
that	sounds	2
sounds	like	2
good	idea	2
bad	my	2
want	it	2
oh	ya	2
ya	ur	2
is	greater	2
more	important	2
greater	than	2
its	safe	2
we	will	2
thought	you	2
using	12	2
negligible	compared	2
fill	out	2
improve	the	2
t	buy	2
buy	it	2
it	if	2
safe	too	2
through	the	2
length	should	2
t	safe	2
safe	we	2
be	same	2
be	fine	2
is	8750	2
good	wrench	2
i	forgot	2
inches	aluminum	2
so	for	2
at	this	2
s	that	2
a	greater	2
our	tutor	2
u	gotta	2
when	were	2
a	word	2
be	right	2
oh	yeah	2
the	line	2
tutor	is	2
happened	to	2
can	fill	2
fill	it	2
you	gotta	2
it	up	2
figure	out	2
the	edge	2
are	they	2
way	it	2
okay	avis	2
us	what	2
the	limit	2
area	stays	2
ok	but	2
like	titanium	2
but	not	2
too	long	2
thats	bad	2
t	read	2
making	the	2
going	on	2
avis	if	2
to	this	2
does	everyone	2
just	the	2
m	going	2
us	avis	2
area	are	2
you	looking	2
same	thing	2
why	can	2
it	stays	2
43	cents	2
mean	it	2
much	cheaper	2
so	about	2
change	length	2
design	our	2
wont	break	2
6	in	2
as	before	2
7	93	2
is	pretty	2
it	gets	2
makes	sense	2
back	on	2
is	to	2
percent	change	2
go	go	2
on	what	2
gives	us	2
to	stay	2
below	the	2
so	my	2
ll	type	2
you	change	2
might	be	2
ft	long	2
bottom	of	2
can	have	2
we	would	2
or	titanium	2
good	deal	2
wait	are	2
front	row	2
force	needed	2
to	think	2
believe	so	2
why	would	2
to	machine	2
was	safe	2
re	gonna	2
gonna	win	2
amazon	gift	2
gift	cards	2
to	avis	2
are	the	2
the	two	2
be	an	2
a	design	2
the	safe	2
yeah	pretty	2
how	bout	2
the	front	2
the	left	2
the	rest	2
rest	of	2
like	you	2
you	doing	2
a	smaller	2
smaller	than	2
12	handle	2
pretty	long	2
can	increase	2
well	the	2
longer	the	2
dont	have	2
achieve	the	2
did	the	2
yes	if	2
is	constant	2
it	comes	2
give	us	2
at	least	2
guess	we	2
be	twice	2
talking	about	2
so	do	2
need	you	2
so	avis	2
moment	is	2
best	of	2
as	design	2
you	for	2
how	come	2
the	allowed	2
allowed	is	2
the	observed	2
can	handle	2
a	tad	2
so	much	2
oh	god	2
we	know	2
omg	stop	2
divide	by	2
like	avis	2
avis	said	2
what	he	2
m	hmm	2
with	me	2
stress	in	2
over	the	2
an	increase	2
mark	erazo	2
who	are	2
other	groups	2
mr	tutor	2
we	only	2
only	have	2
stress	that	2
even	need	2
that	seems	2
so	where	2
m	fd	2
it	not	2
you	have	2
switch	to	2
m	guessing	2
you	did	2
everything	doubles	2
think	that	2
guess	it	2
doesnt	matter	2
the	properties	2
teach	us	2
the	calculator	2
so	far	2
so	are	2
so	titanium	2
you	know	2
know	this	2
would	make	2
one	or	2
just	leaving	2
12	still	2
is	all	2
we	already	2
to	just	2
it	all	2
for	part	2
leaving	it	2
thickness	and	2
my	head	2
aluminum	one	2
design	is	2
stop	ignoring	2
ignoring	me	2
go	ahead	2
u	just	2
5	minutes	2
is	max	2
of	saftey	2
think	they	2
like	what	2
they	want	2
like	that	2
decided	to	2
shorten	the	2
work	through	2
amount	of	2
the	next	2
our	material	2
and	safe	2
safe	to	2
next	iteration	2
so	now	2
what	if	2
it	only	2
long	enough	2
that	it	2
so	this	2
or	so	2
can	answer	2
the	weight	2
the	others	2
safe	then	2
ok	we	2
double	everything	2
waiting	for	2
s	with	2
8	in	2
to	discuss	2
get	it	2
whats	good	2
next	to	2
which	one	2
strength	and	2
next	time	2
not	matter	2
and	how	2
one	is	2
s	work	2
go	faster	2
a	really	2
long	aluminum	2
its	cheaper	2
and	will	2
16	inches	2
same	and	2
t	go	2
takes	to	2
we	increase	2
s	so	2
aluminum	with	2
would	not	2
not	be	2
i	get	2
a	third	2
we	say	2
let	us	2
the	cnc	2
everyone	else	2
lot	of	2
on	this	2
it	becomes	2
hell	yeah	2
cost	be	2
stress	goes	2
than	8750	2
oh	well	2
ah	that	2
means	you	2
is	an	2
idea	for	2

anyone	else	2
the	price	2

avis	ok	2
1	20	2
my	computer	2
is	perfect	2

does	that	2
increase	stress	2
it	goes	2
al	is	2
for	all	2
it	doesnt	2
wat	is	2
see	why	2
than	steel	2
and	force	2
i	didnt	2
also	cost	2
yeah	but	2
ve	been	2
only	thing	2
haha	no	2
t	even	2
with	ease	2
good	trade	2
trade	off	2
but	also	2
ilb	in	2
be	more	2
the	costs	2
job	guys	2
hope	we	2
we	win	2
go	back	2
uhh	what	2
unless	we	2
using	proe	2
15000lb	in	2
its	proportional	2
and	see	2
do	75	2
75	increase	2
inches	long	2
