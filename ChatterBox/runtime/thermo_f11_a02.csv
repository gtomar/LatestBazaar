5,Doctor Bob,"Hi - I'm Doctor Bob, your instructor for today's lab.",30 . 11 . 2011,05.06.54,
6,Jimmy the Student,"...hi, everyone! I'm Jimmy. I'm a prospective engineering student.",30 . 11 . 2011,05.07.04,
7,Doctor Bob,"You're working together, but you've each got a different design goal - it's at the top of your worksheet.",30 . 11 . 2011,05.07.20,
8,Doctor Bob,Take a moment to share your goal with your partner.,30 . 11 . 2011,05.07.23,
9,mmcphers,leaves the room,30 . 11 . 2011,05.07.41,
10,sa11,joins the room,30 . 11 . 2011,05.07.59,
11,sa02,mine is to make a cycle that is the most environmentally friendly (green) as possible,30 . 11 . 2011,05.08.03,
12,Jimmy the Student,... okay,30 . 11 . 2011,05.08.07,
13,Doctor Bob,"To help you meet your design goals, we are going to discuss some of the parameters given on the worksheet.",30 . 11 . 2011,05.08.23,
14,Doctor Bob,Lets start with Tmax.,30 . 11 . 2011,05.08.26,
15,Doctor Bob,"Before we optimize Tmax, you must understand its effects on the cycle properties.",30 . 11 . 2011,05.08.30,
16,Doctor Bob,Are you ready to talk about this?,30 . 11 . 2011,05.08.33,
17,sa02,yes,30 . 11 . 2011,05.08.37,
18,sa11,making the efficiency as high as possible,30 . 11 . 2011,05.08.40,
19,Doctor Bob,"If you increase the maximum temperature (T @ S2) of the cycle, what happens to the cycle efficiency?",30 . 11 . 2011,05.08.41,
20,Doctor Bob,That's right. Efficiency increases.,30 . 11 . 2011,05.08.46,
21,Doctor Bob,"In general, increasing efficiency is good both for power output and environmental impact, although in this case, we will see that increasing heat input to the cycle comes with a negative environmental impact.",30 . 11 . 2011,05.08.50,
22,Doctor Bob,We see this in Graph 1 on your worksheet.,30 . 11 . 2011,05.08.54,
23,Doctor Bob,Lets think about it in a bit more detail. What happens to the net power output of the cycle when you increase Tmax?,30 . 11 . 2011,05.08.58,
24,sa02,it increases,30 . 11 . 2011,05.09.07,
25,Doctor Bob,You are right. The net power output increases.,30 . 11 . 2011,05.09.12,
26,Doctor Bob,We see this in Graph 4 on your worksheet.,30 . 11 . 2011,05.09.15,
27,Doctor Bob,"On the other hand, what about waste heat? Does it increase or decrease?",30 . 11 . 2011,05.09.19,
28,sa02,decrease,30 . 11 . 2011,05.09.34,
29,Doctor Bob,The heat rejected by the cycle increases by increasing Tmax.,30 . 11 . 2011,05.09.42,
30,Doctor Bob,We see this in Graph 3 of the worksheet.,30 . 11 . 2011,05.09.46,
31,Doctor Bob,"Conceptually, any thoughts on why increasing Tmax has these effects?",30 . 11 . 2011,05.09.49,
32,Doctor Bob,"At higher Tmax, more heat is added to the working fluid in the cycle, which does more work, thereby increasing the efficiency. But it also rejects more heat.",30 . 11 . 2011,05.10.43,
33,sa11,im here,30 . 11 . 2011,05.10.44,
34,Doctor Bob,BTW: Is it safe to keep increasing Tmax?,30 . 11 . 2011,05.10.47,
35,sa02,oh okay just checking,30 . 11 . 2011,05.10.51,
36,sa02,no it isn't safe,30 . 11 . 2011,05.10.54,
37,Jimmy the Student,Ok,30 . 11 . 2011,05.10.57,
38,sa11,no,30 . 11 . 2011,05.10.58,
39,Doctor Bob,"Good. Material properties constrain the maximum temperature we can use in a Cycle. For our cycle, Tmax cannot be more than 570C",30 . 11 . 2011,05.10.58,
40,Doctor Bob,Try using this understanding that our team now shares to come up with a potential value of Tmax (T @ S2) that will help you meet your objectives.,30 . 11 . 2011,05.11.03,
41,Doctor Bob,We will move on to considering Pmax in a few minutes.,30 . 11 . 2011,05.11.06,
42,Jimmy the Student,"sa11, I don't get it - why can't t-max be any higher?",30 . 11 . 2011,05.11.43,
43,sa11,making T max about 450,30 . 11 . 2011,05.12.15,
44,Doctor Bob,So...,30 . 11 . 2011,05.12.41,
45,sa11,or a little higher,30 . 11 . 2011,05.12.42,
46,Doctor Bob,Have you decided on some values for Tmax?,30 . 11 . 2011,05.12.44,
47,sa02,why can't it be 570?,30 . 11 . 2011,05.12.59,
48,sa11,yeah,30 . 11 . 2011,05.13.26,
49,sa11,570 it is?,30 . 11 . 2011,05.14.20,
50,Jimmy the Student,"Do you have any thoughts, sa02?",30 . 11 . 2011,05.14.25,
51,sa02,i think it's 570,30 . 11 . 2011,05.14.32,
52,sa11,lets start talkin about max pressure,30 . 11 . 2011,05.15.03,
53,sa02,okay,30 . 11 . 2011,05.15.11,
54,sa11,i say 13000 kpa,30 . 11 . 2011,05.15.31,
55,sa02,"yeah, that seems right if you look at graph 8",30 . 11 . 2011,05.15.41,
56,sa02,that would be the peak of the graph,30 . 11 . 2011,05.15.46,
57,sa11,yeah,30 . 11 . 2011,05.16.00,
58,Doctor Bob,"Ok now, let's spend some time talking about Pmax. You can come back to Tmax in the end.",30 . 11 . 2011,05.16.03,
59,Doctor Bob,Shall we start talking about the system's pressure?,30 . 11 . 2011,05.16.07,
60,Doctor Bob,What would happen to cycle efficiency if you increase the maximum pressure in the cycle (P @ S1)?,30 . 11 . 2011,05.16.11,
61,sa02,it would increase,30 . 11 . 2011,05.16.21,
62,Doctor Bob,You got that right. The efficiency of the cycle increases.,30 . 11 . 2011,05.16.30,
63,Doctor Bob,We see this in Graph 5 on your worksheet.,30 . 11 . 2011,05.16.33,
64,Doctor Bob,"On the other hand, what happens to the steam quality at the turbine exit (S3) by increasing Pmax?",30 . 11 . 2011,05.16.37,
65,sa11,decreases,30 . 11 . 2011,05.16.47,
66,Doctor Bob,Right. Steam quality drops as we see in Graph 6.,30 . 11 . 2011,05.16.55,
67,Doctor Bob,Let's take a closer look at this. What happens to the amount of heat rejected by the cycle on increasing Pmax?,30 . 11 . 2011,05.16.59,
68,sa02,increases,30 . 11 . 2011,05.17.04,
69,Doctor Bob,"At higher Pmax, the need to reject heat to the environment reduces.",30 . 11 . 2011,05.17.11,
70,Doctor Bob,We see this in graph 7.,30 . 11 . 2011,05.17.14,
71,Doctor Bob,What about the net power generated by the cycle? Does it increase?,30 . 11 . 2011,05.17.17,
72,sa11,increases then decreases,30 . 11 . 2011,05.17.20,
73,Doctor Bob,"As you see in graph 8, the net power output increases to some extent upon increasing Pmax, but it reduces thereafter.",30 . 11 . 2011,05.17.27,
74,Doctor Bob,Can you explain why increasing Pmax improves efficiency and reduces heat rejected to the environment?,30 . 11 . 2011,05.17.31,
75,sa11,no,30 . 11 . 2011,05.18.02,
76,Doctor Bob,"By increasing Pmax, heat is added to the cycle at a higher temperature, which leads to higher carnot efficiency. The T-S diagram on Page 23 of the book explains this.",30 . 11 . 2011,05.18.27,
77,Doctor Bob,"One final note about Pmax: Like Tmax, it is bound by material strength and cannot be too high.",30 . 11 . 2011,05.18.31,
78,Doctor Bob,Let's try to apply this knowledge to choose a good value for Pmax that meets your objectives. We'll talk about Q-in after that.,30 . 11 . 2011,05.18.35,
79,sa02,13000 kpa,30 . 11 . 2011,05.18.43,
80,sa11,i concur,30 . 11 . 2011,05.18.59,
81,Jimmy the Student,m-hmm,30 . 11 . 2011,05.19.02,
82,Jimmy the Student,"I didn't follow that, sa02 - what's important for max pressure?",30 . 11 . 2011,05.19.11,
83,sa02,what do you mean what's important?,30 . 11 . 2011,05.19.31,
84,sa02,we want it to not be too high or too low to get the greatest net power output,30 . 11 . 2011,05.19.50,
85,Doctor Bob,Time for discussing the pressure is almost up...,30 . 11 . 2011,05.20.11,
86,Doctor Bob,Is there any consensus on a value?,30 . 11 . 2011,05.20.14,
87,sa02,yes,30 . 11 . 2011,05.20.18,
88,sa11,yes,30 . 11 . 2011,05.20.19,
89,sa02,we chose 13000 kPa,30 . 11 . 2011,05.20.23,
90,sa11,we decieded 13000,30 . 11 . 2011,05.20.32,
91,sa11,kpa,30 . 11 . 2011,05.20.34,
92,sa02,yup,30 . 11 . 2011,05.20.36,
93,sa11,kPa,30 . 11 . 2011,05.20.40,
94,sa11,i say we move on to minimum pressure,30 . 11 . 2011,05.21.08,
95,sa02,ok,30 . 11 . 2011,05.21.20,
96,sa02,sure,30 . 11 . 2011,05.21.21,
97,Jimmy the Student,m-hmm,30 . 11 . 2011,05.21.25,
98,sa02,maybe somwhere around 9000,30 . 11 . 2011,05.21.35,
99,sa02,?,30 . 11 . 2011,05.21.36,
100,sa11,i was thinking between 130-200,30 . 11 . 2011,05.21.36,
101,Jimmy the Student,gotcha.,30 . 11 . 2011,05.21.39,
102,sa02,oh okay,30 . 11 . 2011,05.21.41,
103,sa02,why so low?,30 . 11 . 2011,05.21.44,
104,sa02,just wondering,30 . 11 . 2011,05.21.50,
105,sa11,9000 is pretty large,30 . 11 . 2011,05.22.20,
106,sa02,"yeah, i was just thinking that if we go so low the power output and efficiency will be really small",30 . 11 . 2011,05.22.37,
107,sa11,not even on the graphs for 9-13,30 . 11 . 2011,05.22.37,
108,Doctor Bob,The last variable we need to discuss is the choice of fuel being used in the boiler.,30 . 11 . 2011,05.22.43,
109,sa02,oh,30 . 11 . 2011,05.22.46,
110,Doctor Bob,Are you ready to discuss this?,30 . 11 . 2011,05.22.46,
111,sa02,okay,30 . 11 . 2011,05.22.48,
112,sa02,good point,30 . 11 . 2011,05.22.49,
113,Jimmy the Student,^_^,30 . 11 . 2011,05.22.52,
114,Doctor Bob,You can see the thermal energies for different fuels on Page 25 of the book. Which fuel is most suitable for high cycle efficiency?,30 . 11 . 2011,05.22.53,
115,sa11,sorry doc,30 . 11 . 2011,05.23.02,
116,sa11,we r on minimum pressure,30 . 11 . 2011,05.23.10,
117,Doctor Bob,So... where were we...,30 . 11 . 2011,05.23.16,
118,Doctor Bob,You can see the thermal energies for different fuels on Page 25 of the book. Which fuel is most suitable for high cycle efficiency?,30 . 11 . 2011,05.23.21,
119,sa02,we were on minimum pressure...,30 . 11 . 2011,05.23.30,
120,Doctor Bob,Nuclear energy has the highest thermal energy.,30 . 11 . 2011,05.23.38,
121,Doctor Bob,Graph 14 shows that cycle efficiency increases by using a fuel with high thermal energy.,30 . 11 . 2011,05.23.42,
122,Doctor Bob,"By using a fuel with higher thermal energy, does the power output increase or decrease?",30 . 11 . 2011,05.23.46,
123,sa02,"ok, so maybe 130 kPa or so is good then",30 . 11 . 2011,05.23.52,
124,Jimmy the Student,:-),30 . 11 . 2011,05.23.56,
125,sa02,like you said before,30 . 11 . 2011,05.24.01,
126,Doctor Bob,Right. Power generated by the cycle increases as shown in graph 17,30 . 11 . 2011,05.24.04,
127,sa11,what do you think,30 . 11 . 2011,05.24.04,
128,Jimmy the Student,:-D,30 . 11 . 2011,05.24.05,
129,Doctor Bob,Can you explain why power generated increases by using a fuel like Nuclear energy?,30 . 11 . 2011,05.24.08,
130,Doctor Bob,Try answering ... this was discussed in the book.,30 . 11 . 2011,05.24.13,
131,Doctor Bob,"As more heat is added to the cycle due to the higher thermal energy of nuclear fuel, more work is done by the steam in the turbine.",30 . 11 . 2011,05.24.59,
132,Doctor Bob,"On the other hand, what happens to heat rejected by the cycle by using a higher thermal energy input?",30 . 11 . 2011,05.25.03,
133,sa11,particle interactions,30 . 11 . 2011,05.25.04,
134,sa02,it decreases,30 . 11 . 2011,05.25.18,
135,sa02,there is less heat rejected,30 . 11 . 2011,05.25.21,
136,Doctor Bob,The heat rejected by the cycle increases by using a higher thermal energy input!,30 . 11 . 2011,05.25.24,
137,Doctor Bob,We see this in Graph 16 of the worksheet.,30 . 11 . 2011,05.25.28,
138,sa02,oh,30 . 11 . 2011,05.25.29,
139,sa02,sorry,30 . 11 . 2011,05.25.30,
140,Doctor Bob,"Now that you have seen how different choices of fuel affect the cycle parameters, you can discuss which fuel might help you to achieve your design objectives.",30 . 11 . 2011,05.25.32,
141,sa02,i thought the graph showed it decreased,30 . 11 . 2011,05.25.48,
142,Jimmy the Student,"hey sa11, what did I miss?",30 . 11 . 2011,05.26.08,
143,Jimmy the Student,"I don't understand, sa11 - why don't we just pick the highest-Q fuel?",30 . 11 . 2011,05.26.15,
144,sa02,because there's more waste heat,30 . 11 . 2011,05.26.36,
145,sa11,i say we go nuclear,30 . 11 . 2011,05.26.39,
146,sa02,oh sorry,30 . 11 . 2011,05.26.39,
147,sa02,okay,30 . 11 . 2011,05.26.42,
148,sa02,yeah nuclear sounds godo,30 . 11 . 2011,05.26.45,
149,sa02,good*,30 . 11 . 2011,05.26.47,
150,Jimmy the Student,^_^,30 . 11 . 2011,05.26.50,
151,sa11,so what do we have then,30 . 11 . 2011,05.27.07,
152,Doctor Bob,Wrap up your discussion of fuel...,30 . 11 . 2011,05.27.08,
153,sa02,we choose nuclear,30 . 11 . 2011,05.27.18,
154,sa11,nuclear,30 . 11 . 2011,05.27.23,
155,sa11,sir,30 . 11 . 2011,05.27.24,
156,Doctor Bob,We are in the final stage of this collaborative design now.,30 . 11 . 2011,05.29.23,
157,Doctor Bob,"Make sure you consider the dependencies between the different parameters, as you choose possible values for your final design.",30 . 11 . 2011,05.29.34,
158,sa02,sure,30 . 11 . 2011,05.29.47,
159,Jimmy the Student,... ok,30 . 11 . 2011,05.29.51,
160,sa11,ok,30 . 11 . 2011,05.30.41,
161,Doctor Bob,Have you taken notes on your worksheet to help you do the final implementation?,30 . 11 . 2011,05.34.23,
162,Doctor Bob,Remember you have to do the final implementations individually.,30 . 11 . 2011,05.34.27,
163,sa02,yup,30 . 11 . 2011,05.34.30,
164,Doctor Bob,"Okay, I've got to go. It's been great working with you!",30 . 11 . 2011,05.36.53,
165,Jimmy the Student,"Bye, everyone! Thanks for the help.",30 . 11 . 2011,05.37.08,
