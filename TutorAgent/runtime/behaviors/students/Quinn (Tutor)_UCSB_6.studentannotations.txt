Quinn (Tutor)_UCSB_6,S07,It's nice to meet you too,
Quinn (Tutor)_UCSB_6,S08,Alright  I'm going to start on part 1.,AFFIRMATIVE
Quinn (Tutor)_UCSB_6,S07,Im on part 1 too,
Quinn (Tutor)_UCSB_6,S08,Quinn  some of the data plots have "#Div/0!",
Quinn (Tutor)_UCSB_6,S08,divide by zero error is that supposed to be there?,QUESTION
Quinn (Tutor)_UCSB_6,S07,mine are not giving that error,
Quinn (Tutor)_UCSB_6,S08,uhh yeah ,AFFIRMATIVE
Quinn (Tutor)_UCSB_6,S08,everything besides my Z displace ment,
Quinn (Tutor)_UCSB_6,S08,has a few plots and then divide by 0 error for the values,
Quinn (Tutor)_UCSB_6,S07,even your X?,QUESTION
Quinn (Tutor)_UCSB_6,S08,not my ,
Quinn (Tutor)_UCSB_6,S08,X,
Quinn (Tutor)_UCSB_6,S07,so the first one where you get the error is theta?,QUESTION
Quinn (Tutor)_UCSB_6,S08,z slope theta ,
Quinn (Tutor)_UCSB_6,S08,I have 4 data points for the first 4  x values,
Quinn (Tutor)_UCSB_6,S08,and then past that its blank,
Quinn (Tutor)_UCSB_6,S08,then the next couple of ones I either have some values or none and then its nothing but Divide by 0 error,
Quinn (Tutor)_UCSB_6,S07,we are suposed to do the calculations,AFFIRMATIVE
Quinn (Tutor)_UCSB_6,S08,oh ,
Quinn (Tutor)_UCSB_6,S08,alright my bad lol,AFFIRMATIVE
Quinn (Tutor)_UCSB_6,S07,np  it basically starts to tell you what to do on like page three,QUESTION
Quinn (Tutor)_UCSB_6,S07,I have poly 2,
Quinn (Tutor)_UCSB_6,S08,I have poly 4 too,
Quinn (Tutor)_UCSB_6,S08,Are you looking at question 1?,QUESTION
Quinn (Tutor)_UCSB_6,S08,S07?,QUESTION
Quinn (Tutor)_UCSB_6,S07,sorry,
Quinn (Tutor)_UCSB_6,S07,yea i am  did you get mainly negative numbers?,AFFIRMATIVE+QUESTION
Quinn (Tutor)_UCSB_6,S08,yes,AFFIRMATIVE
Quinn (Tutor)_UCSB_6,S07,ok,AFFIRMATIVE
Quinn (Tutor)_UCSB_6,S08,ok looking at the question,AFFIRMATIVE
Quinn (Tutor)_UCSB_6,S08,it asks,
Quinn (Tutor)_UCSB_6,S08,what conditions on vertical displacement and slope are being applied at each end,QUESTION
Quinn (Tutor)_UCSB_6,S07,right,
Quinn (Tutor)_UCSB_6,S07,more specifically  1) which end(s) displace vertically,PREDICTION_CONTRIBUTION
Quinn (Tutor)_UCSB_6,S07,For my data  97micrometers has displacement 0 and 0 has a certaing displacement,
Quinn (Tutor)_UCSB_6,S07,is that the type of info theyre looking for?,QUESTION+PREDICTION_CONTRIBUTION
Quinn (Tutor)_UCSB_6,S08,its the same for me,FIRST_NAME
Quinn (Tutor)_UCSB_6,S08,I have a negative displacement for 0,
Quinn (Tutor)_UCSB_6,S08,and then it gets less and less,PREDICTION_CONTRIBUTION
Quinn (Tutor)_UCSB_6,S08,reaching 0,PREDICTION_CONTRIBUTION
Quinn (Tutor)_UCSB_6,S07,i have a positive displacement,
Quinn (Tutor)_UCSB_6,S07,but I think we just have to say the info for our own info,EXPLANATION_CONTRIBUTION+PREDICTION_CONTRIBUTION
Quinn (Tutor)_UCSB_6,S07,but look at what you got for slope for 97  I got 0,QUESTION
Quinn (Tutor)_UCSB_6,S08,exactly slope 97?,QUESTION
Quinn (Tutor)_UCSB_6,S08,because my data x extends to 99.2409,EXPLANATION_CONTRIBUTION+IDEA_CONTRIBUTION
Quinn (Tutor)_UCSB_6,S08,which is where it equates to 0,
Quinn (Tutor)_UCSB_6,S07,my info only goes up to 97.0632  but thats where it becomes 0,PREDICTION_CONTRIBUTION
Quinn (Tutor)_UCSB_6,S08,yeah mine ends at 99.2409,AFFIRMATIVE
Quinn (Tutor)_UCSB_6,S08,thats where it becomes 0,
Quinn (Tutor)_UCSB_6,S07,but essentially we have the same answers for number one  the furthest end has no displacement and slope 0,FIRST_NAME
Quinn (Tutor)_UCSB_6,S08,I guess it's basically just 97 cause at 97 you're not supposed to experience displacement since it's fixed ,EXPLANATION_CONTRIBUTION
Quinn (Tutor)_UCSB_6,S07,yea exactly,
Quinn (Tutor)_UCSB_6,S08,yeah,AFFIRMATIVE
Quinn (Tutor)_UCSB_6,S08,what about rotation?,QUESTION
Quinn (Tutor)_UCSB_6,S07,rotation should just mean slope right?,QUESTION
Quinn (Tutor)_UCSB_6,S08,hold on,
Quinn (Tutor)_UCSB_6,S08,your slope becomes 0?,QUESTION
Quinn (Tutor)_UCSB_6,S07,yeaa,
Quinn (Tutor)_UCSB_6,S08,my slope is not 0 at any point,
Quinn (Tutor)_UCSB_6,S08,	that's strange,
Quinn (Tutor)_UCSB_6,S08,I dont have slope = 0 at any point,
Quinn (Tutor)_UCSB_6,S08,it becomes close but it doesnt equate to 0 ,
Quinn (Tutor)_UCSB_6,S07,well  my slope becomes .0009,
Quinn (Tutor)_UCSB_6,S07,which in micro meters  i think we should assume is 0,EXPLANATION_CONTRIBUTION+IDEA_CONTRIBUTION+PREDICTION_CONTRIBUTION
Quinn (Tutor)_UCSB_6,S08,uhh,
Quinn (Tutor)_UCSB_6,S08,mine is .01456871 at 97,
Quinn (Tutor)_UCSB_6,S07,oh  hmm,
Quinn (Tutor)_UCSB_6,S08,and I dont have a valuje for the first 2 X values,
Quinn (Tutor)_UCSB_6,S08,0 and .3111 are blank,
Quinn (Tutor)_UCSB_6,S07,yea theyre blank  because their method of getting slope involves taking the difference in displacement from 2 excel boxes to each side,EXPLANATION_CONTRIBUTION+IDEA_CONTRIBUTION+PREDICTION_CONTRIBUTION
Quinn (Tutor)_UCSB_6,S08,oh alright,AFFIRMATIVE
Quinn (Tutor)_UCSB_6,S08,but neither ends equate to 0 for me,
Quinn (Tutor)_UCSB_6,S08,so I guess both ends experience rotation,
Quinn (Tutor)_UCSB_6,S07,yea i guess,
Quinn (Tutor)_UCSB_6,S07,but for my problem number one  it also says x=97Âµm end is connected 
to a large  essentially rigid block of polysilicon,
Quinn (Tutor)_UCSB_6,S07,and is to say thats the end that shouldn't move or rotate,PREDICTION_CONTRIBUTION
Quinn (Tutor)_UCSB_6,S08,yeah,AFFIRMATIVE
Quinn (Tutor)_UCSB_6,S08,I dont think mine makes sense cause if one of my ends equates to 0,EXPLANATION_CONTRIBUTION
Quinn (Tutor)_UCSB_6,S08,for the displacement ,
Quinn (Tutor)_UCSB_6,S08,then the derivative of that is most certainly going to be 0 as well right?,QUESTION
Quinn (Tutor)_UCSB_6,S08,I think I'm better off answering  only end x=0 experiences a displacement,EXPLANATION_CONTRIBUTION
Quinn (Tutor)_UCSB_6,S07,i want to say it should be,
Quinn (Tutor)_UCSB_6,S07,yea  displacement for sure,AFFIRMATIVE
Quinn (Tutor)_UCSB_6,S07,and then we solved for the slope at end 1,
Quinn (Tutor)_UCSB_6,S07,that should still be somewhat correct,
Quinn (Tutor)_UCSB_6,S08,alright,AFFIRMATIVE
Quinn (Tutor)_UCSB_6,S08,lets go on to problem 2,IDEA_CONTRIBUTION
Quinn (Tutor)_UCSB_6,S08,oh by the way my displacement graph is,
Quinn (Tutor)_UCSB_6,S08,like that except more straight lol,PREDICTION_CONTRIBUTION
Quinn (Tutor)_UCSB_6,S07,gotcha,
Quinn (Tutor)_UCSB_6,S08,you know the equations for number 2?,QUESTION
Quinn (Tutor)_UCSB_6,S07,thats what my displacement one looks like,QUESTION
Quinn (Tutor)_UCSB_6,S07,and the equations are EIV=M?,QUESTION
Quinn (Tutor)_UCSB_6,S07,** EIV'' = M,
Quinn (Tutor)_UCSB_6,S08,yeah that looks familiar,AFFIRMATIVE
Quinn (Tutor)_UCSB_6,S08,I think if anything we can just do number 2 on our own by looking at the equations in the book?,EXPLANATION_CONTRIBUTION+IDEA_CONTRIBUTION+QUESTION+PREDICTION_CONTRIBUTION
Quinn (Tutor)_UCSB_6,S08,so on to number 3?,QUESTION
Quinn (Tutor)_UCSB_6,S07,sure,AFFIRMATIVE
Quinn (Tutor)_UCSB_6,S08,ok,AFFIRMATIVE
Quinn (Tutor)_UCSB_6,S08,so your curve is this right,
Quinn (Tutor)_UCSB_6,S08,your curve is basically my curve except the other way?,QUESTION
Quinn (Tutor)_UCSB_6,S07,yea  which makes sense since your displacement is negative when mine is positive,EXPLANATION_CONTRIBUTION
Quinn (Tutor)_UCSB_6,S08,ok then from that your 0 is at end 0,AFFIRMATIVE
Quinn (Tutor)_UCSB_6,S08,?,QUESTION
Quinn (Tutor)_UCSB_6,S08,cause my 0 is at end 97,EXPLANATION_CONTRIBUTION
Quinn (Tutor)_UCSB_6,S07,no  displacement = 0 at 97,
Quinn (Tutor)_UCSB_6,S08,oh alright,AFFIRMATIVE
Quinn (Tutor)_UCSB_6,S08,my bad it was just the negative values then,
Quinn (Tutor)_UCSB_6,S08,lol,
Quinn (Tutor)_UCSB_6,S07,yea,
Quinn (Tutor)_UCSB_6,S08,alright let's look at part a,AFFIRMATIVE
Quinn (Tutor)_UCSB_6,S08,so the equation is EIV''=M,
Quinn (Tutor)_UCSB_6,S08,?,QUESTION
Quinn (Tutor)_UCSB_6,S07,well  when is bending stress max?,FIRST_NAME+QUESTION
Quinn (Tutor)_UCSB_6,S07,and yea  it is,
Quinn (Tutor)_UCSB_6,S07,my bad  dont know how to get rid of that,
Quinn (Tutor)_UCSB_6,S08,dont worry about it,
Quinn (Tutor)_UCSB_6,S08,I'll look in the book,PREDICTION_CONTRIBUTION
Quinn (Tutor)_UCSB_6,S08,to be honest  I have a hard time paying attention in class so I usually just look at the material right before the exam,PREDICTION_CONTRIBUTION
Quinn (Tutor)_UCSB_6,S08,lol,
Quinn (Tutor)_UCSB_6,S07,same here,FIRST_NAME
Quinn (Tutor)_UCSB_6,S07,im looking at the book too,
Quinn (Tutor)_UCSB_6,S07,so our equations for number two are on page 683,
Quinn (Tutor)_UCSB_6,S08,ya,
Quinn (Tutor)_UCSB_6,S08,v is the bending stress right,FIRST_NAME
Quinn (Tutor)_UCSB_6,S07,i think v is the dispacement  v' is the slope and v'' is the curvature,EXPLANATION_CONTRIBUTION
Quinn (Tutor)_UCSB_6,S08,I'm guessing the more curvature the more bending stress?,FIRST_NAME+QUESTION+PREDICTION_CONTRIBUTION
Quinn (Tutor)_UCSB_6,S07,right thats what i want to say  i just cant find it in the book,QUESTION+PREDICTION_CONTRIBUTION
Quinn (Tutor)_UCSB_6,S08,is your kappa graph,
Quinn (Tutor)_UCSB_6,S08,really scattered,
Quinn (Tutor)_UCSB_6,S07,M is the bending moment,FIRST_NAME
Quinn (Tutor)_UCSB_6,S08,a bunch fo scattered plots,
Quinn (Tutor)_UCSB_6,S07,yea kinda,
Quinn (Tutor)_UCSB_6,S07,and really zig zaggy,
Quinn (Tutor)_UCSB_6,S08,hmm,
Quinn (Tutor)_UCSB_6,S07,funny,
Quinn (Tutor)_UCSB_6,S08,I'm going to go with maximum deflection = maximum bending stress,FIRST_NAME
Quinn (Tutor)_UCSB_6,S07,ch 8 states stress = -My/I,
Quinn (Tutor)_UCSB_6,S08,y is vertical displacement right?,QUESTION
Quinn (Tutor)_UCSB_6,S07,well  in a bar  y is the distance from the center of the bar,PREDICTION_CONTRIBUTION
Quinn (Tutor)_UCSB_6,S07,still within the beam,
Quinn (Tutor)_UCSB_6,S07,ok  so maximem bending stress : maximum bending moment,FIRST_NAME+AFFIRMATIVE
Quinn (Tutor)_UCSB_6,S08,ok well,AFFIRMATIVE
Quinn (Tutor)_UCSB_6,S08,for me my displacement graph,
Quinn (Tutor)_UCSB_6,S08,starts at a value around -.8,
Quinn (Tutor)_UCSB_6,S07,and i want to say that my kappa is greatest around 10,
Quinn (Tutor)_UCSB_6,S08,and then peaks at something like -1,
Quinn (Tutor)_UCSB_6,S08,and then increases linearly until 0,IDEA_CONTRIBUTION+PREDICTION_CONTRIBUTION
Quinn (Tutor)_UCSB_6,S08,same,FIRST_NAME
Quinn (Tutor)_UCSB_6,S08,That means for part a,
Quinn (Tutor)_UCSB_6,S08,yes  we would expect same results,FIRST_NAME+AFFIRMATIVE+EXPLANATION_CONTRIBUTION
Quinn (Tutor)_UCSB_6,S07,right because our kappa = v'' which is proportional to M,EXPLANATION_CONTRIBUTION+IDEA_CONTRIBUTION
Quinn (Tutor)_UCSB_6,S07,and it is max around the same value,FIRST_NAME
Quinn (Tutor)_UCSB_6,S08,yup,AFFIRMATIVE
Quinn (Tutor)_UCSB_6,S08,part b is answered then,
Quinn (Tutor)_UCSB_6,S08,roughly around 10,

Quinn (Tutor)_UCSB_6,S08,problem 4?,QUESTION
Quinn (Tutor)_UCSB_6,S07,yea,
Quinn (Tutor)_UCSB_6,S08,so now we calculate max bending stress,FIRST_NAME
Quinn (Tutor)_UCSB_6,S08,stress = -My/I,
Quinn (Tutor)_UCSB_6,S08,so I guess we use the data to calculate M ,
Quinn (Tutor)_UCSB_6,S08,right,
Quinn (Tutor)_UCSB_6,S08,where v'' is greatest is probably the value we want to use?,QUESTION
Quinn (Tutor)_UCSB_6,S08,EIV'' = M,
Quinn (Tutor)_UCSB_6,S07,i want to say yep,AFFIRMATIVE
Quinn (Tutor)_UCSB_6,S08,ok,AFFIRMATIVE
Quinn (Tutor)_UCSB_6,S08,so I used a function,
