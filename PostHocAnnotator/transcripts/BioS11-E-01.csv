517CN3,joins the room,23.01.2012,09.42.41
515CN3,joins the room,23.01.2012,09.42.58
515CN3,hey tanner,23.01.2012,09.43.32
517CN3,hey,23.01.2012,09.43.44
TUTOR,"Hi, my name is Sage. I'll be working with you in this activity. Take a minute to introduce yourselves.",23.01.2012,09.43.59
515CN3,what you doing,23.01.2012,09.44.02
515CN3,my name is dominmique and im in mr TEACHERs biology i love working what about you,23.01.2012,09.44.41
TUTOR,"I won't tell you if you're right or wrong, but I'll give feedback as you discuss things as a team.",23.01.2012,09.44.44
TUTOR,Let's look at a setup which is the opposite of the one we saw earlier - the iodine is now inside and the starch is outside.,23.01.2012,09.45.00
TUTOR,"<< On the whiteboard, you can see a picture of this new setup.",23.01.2012,09.45.27
515CN3,yes,23.01.2012,09.45.38
TUTOR,<< Here's what happened in this setup over time.,23.01.2012,09.45.40
TUTOR,Notice how the inside and outside environments changed. Why did these changes happen?,23.01.2012,09.46.02
TUTOR,I'd love to hear more from 517CN3...,23.01.2012,09.46.38
532CN3,joins the room,23.01.2012,09.46.45
515CN3,help us please,23.01.2012,09.47.27
TUTOR,"Thanks for keeping the discussion going, 515CN3. :-)",23.01.2012,09.47.31
517CN3,so over time the weight changed?,23.01.2012,09.47.43
515CN3,help us please,23.01.2012,09.47.44
TUTOR,"Thanks for that, 515CN3. Can anyone respond?",23.01.2012,09.47.48
515CN3,can you repeat that,23.01.2012,09.48.19
532CN3,IODINE CAME OUT THE BAG,23.01.2012,09.48.20
TUTOR,"Thanks for keeping the discussion going, 515CN3. :-)",23.01.2012,09.48.23
517CN3,i think starch came out of the bag,23.01.2012,09.48.47
TUTOR,"Thanks for starting a prediction, 517CN3.",23.01.2012,09.48.51
515CN3,the iodine came out the starch,23.01.2012,09.49.21
TUTOR,"Okay, team - in a moment we'll move to another set of experiments.",23.01.2012,09.49.34
TUTOR,"For these experiments, we'll use the same membrane, but with pure water on the outside and a glucose solution on the inside.",23.01.2012,09.49.58
515CN3,the iodine came out the bag,23.01.2012,09.50.01
517CN3,but the iodine was outside of the bag,23.01.2012,09.50.28
TUTOR,Discuss the differences between glucose and starch molecules.,23.01.2012,09.50.29
532CN3,IDK what glucose is,23.01.2012,09.51.00
TUTOR,We'll use the tube weight as an indicator for water movement.,23.01.2012,09.51.21
TUTOR,We'll also use *glucose test strips* to detect glucose in both environments.,23.01.2012,09.51.25
TUTOR,"<< On the whiteboard, you can see what happened in this setup over time.",23.01.2012,09.51.39
515CN3,the glucose that we juss seen made a stick change colors one was yellow and one was green,23.01.2012,09.51.44
TUTOR,"The results with glucose are different than what you saw with starch - as a team, discuss and agree upon an explanation for these results.",23.01.2012,09.52.03
515CN3,the bag went changing weight it increases,23.01.2012,09.52.13
532CN3,the weight changed over time,23.01.2012,09.53.32
517CN3,the glucose came out of the bag and the water whent into the bag,23.01.2012,09.53.40
532CN3,how do u know,23.01.2012,09.54.03
515CN3,and the glucose changed colors and the iodine left went into the bag,23.01.2012,09.54.03
532CN3,how do you know,23.01.2012,09.54.25
517CN3,because the test strips changed,23.01.2012,09.54.26
515CN3,how do u know what ?????,23.01.2012,09.54.27
TUTOR,"Thanks for offering an explanation, 517CN3 :-)",23.01.2012,09.54.30
532CN3,ok,23.01.2012,09.54.41
515CN3,tanner how do you,23.01.2012,09.55.21
TUTOR,Great! Can someone respond to 515CN3?,23.01.2012,09.55.24
532CN3,montana said hi dominqueb,23.01.2012,09.55.34
TUTOR,"Okay, we've kind of stalled. Can someone summarize the discussion so far?",23.01.2012,09.55.38
TUTOR,"Okay, everyone - let's move on to the last experiment.",23.01.2012,09.55.43
515CN3,hello,23.01.2012,09.55.56
TUTOR,"In this setup we have glucose solution on the outside, pure water on the inside.",23.01.2012,09.56.02
532CN3,the glucose came out of the bag each time,23.01.2012,09.56.06
517CN3,because the test strip taht was in the water changed from yellow to green,23.01.2012,09.56.09
TUTOR,"What changes do you think you'll see in this condition? Agree on a prediction for what you'll observe over time, *and* an explanation that everyone understands.",23.01.2012,09.56.26
515CN3,exactly but before what you said about the starch how did you know,23.01.2012,09.56.43
517CN3,what do you mean,23.01.2012,09.57.35
TUTOR,"Perfect time for a re-voicing, 517CN3.",23.01.2012,09.57.39
515CN3,an observation would be that glucose changed colors as it sat in the water and the water didnt go in side the starch but the iodine did go inside the starch,23.01.2012,09.58.48
(money talks),joins the room,23.01.2012,09.59.34
(money talks),leaves the room,23.01.2012,09.59.39
TUTOR,"Make sure each of you is clear on your team's prediction and explanation, and write it in your worksheet.",23.01.2012,10.00.04
TUTOR,"All right, we're wrapping up. Thanks, team!",23.01.2012,10.00.47
515CN3,what do youll think its going to change too,23.01.2012,10.01.23
515CN3,and the weight,23.01.2012,10.01.29
532CN3,whats our prediction,23.01.2012,10.01.39
517CN3,ok so the tube is stilled filled with water instead of glucose,23.01.2012,10.01.49
532CN3,that's the prediction,23.01.2012,10.02.09
515CN3,BACKSLASHwhats the color inside the tube,23.01.2012,10.02.17
517CN3,yellow,23.01.2012,10.02.38
515CN3,outside,23.01.2012,10.02.48
532CN3,what's the predictiobn,23.01.2012,10.03.39
517CN3,for outside after 24 hours it should be green,23.01.2012,10.03.44
517CN3,i mean outside,23.01.2012,10.03.56
515CN3,whats the weight youll think,23.01.2012,10.04.07
517CN3,0.59g,23.01.2012,10.04.23
515CN3,why do u say 0.59,23.01.2012,10.04.49
517CN3,its just a gess,23.01.2012,10.05.22
532CN3,whats the outside color,23.01.2012,10.05.56
TUTOR,leaves the room,23.01.2012,10.35.16
517CN3,leaves the room,23.01.2012,10.36.04
515CN3,leaves the room,23.01.2012,10.36.45
532CN3,leaves the room,23.01.2012,10.40.53
