473CS9,yaaay,19.01.2012,02.19.18
488CS9,haha what are we suppost to be doing?,19.01.2012,02.19.37
473CS9,amonalonalon,19.01.2012,02.19.38
473CS9,and Idfk,19.01.2012,02.19.43
466CS9,hi EVeryone :},19.01.2012,02.19.56
TUTOR,joins the room,19.01.2012,02.19.58
TUTOR,Let's look at a setup which is the opposite of the one we saw earlier - the iodine is now inside and the starch is outside.,19.01.2012,02.20.04
473CS9,you gon' Learn today .,19.01.2012,02.20.18
466CS9,Yea,19.01.2012,02.20.26
TUTOR,"<< On the whiteboard, you can see a picture of this new setup.",19.01.2012,02.20.31
466CS9,yes,19.01.2012,02.20.41
TUTOR,<< Here's what happened in this setup over time.,19.01.2012,02.20.44
TUTOR,Notice how the inside and outside environments changed. Why did these changes happen?,19.01.2012,02.21.06
473CS9,alright alriiiiiiiiiiiight alright !,19.01.2012,02.21.23
466CS9,Cuz u reversed the process,19.01.2012,02.21.31
488CS9,because you put in the starch and water?,19.01.2012,02.22.08
466CS9,Come on guys anwser,19.01.2012,02.22.11
TUTOR,"Keep on explaining, 488CS9.",19.01.2012,02.22.12
466CS9,or,19.01.2012,02.22.13
473CS9,because.............its in some water,19.01.2012,02.22.26
466CS9,AMANDA UR TURN!!!!!!!,19.01.2012,02.22.55
488CS9,it changed colors because the lodine and water had a reaction to the starch and water?,19.01.2012,02.23.02
TUTOR,It's nice that you're explaining your reasoning.,19.01.2012,02.23.06
473CS9,"tutor, you're so smart.",19.01.2012,02.23.23
TUTOR,I'd love to hear more from 488CS9...,19.01.2012,02.23.24
488CS9,idk what else to say haha,19.01.2012,02.23.53
473CS9,the water doesn't like starch?,19.01.2012,02.24.25
466CS9,The starch got into the bag and mixed with the iodine,19.01.2012,02.24.26
TUTOR,Can you say more about how we use indicators?,19.01.2012,02.24.30
TUTOR,"Okay, team - in a moment we'll move to another set of experiments.",19.01.2012,02.24.39
466CS9,ok,19.01.2012,02.24.51
473CS9,alright alright alriiiiiiiiiiight,19.01.2012,02.25.02
TUTOR,"For these experiments, we'll use the same membrane, but with pure water on the outside and a glucose solution on the inside.",19.01.2012,02.25.02
466CS9,ok,19.01.2012,02.25.18
473CS9,what?,19.01.2012,02.25.26
TUTOR,Discuss the differences between glucose and starch molecules.,19.01.2012,02.25.33
466CS9,glucose is lighter,19.01.2012,02.26.09
466CS9,the starch is heavier,19.01.2012,02.26.25
TUTOR,We'll use the tube weight as an indicator for water movement.,19.01.2012,02.26.25
TUTOR,We'll also use *glucose test strips* to detect glucose in both environments.,19.01.2012,02.26.29
473CS9,they're.......different . Um glucose is a simple molucule and starch isn't?,19.01.2012,02.26.31
TUTOR,"<< On the whiteboard, you can see what happened in this setup over time.",19.01.2012,02.26.43
466CS9,yea we can,19.01.2012,02.26.54
TUTOR,"The results with glucose are different than what you saw with starch - as a team, discuss and agree upon an explanation for these results.",19.01.2012,02.27.07
466CS9,the glucose got heavier as the time went on,19.01.2012,02.27.17
473CS9,because the starch got in it],19.01.2012,02.27.54
TUTOR,"Keep on explaining, 473CS9.",19.01.2012,02.27.57
473CS9,the thing might not be closed all the way and that's why it caused the reaction it did,19.01.2012,02.28.26
466CS9,the glucose got in the water,19.01.2012,02.28.30
473CS9,du .....hello?,19.01.2012,02.29.38
488CS9,hahaah,19.01.2012,02.29.48
466CS9,it mixed with the water and the test strip turned green because of how much glucose is in the water,19.01.2012,02.29.57
TUTOR,"Would that be the same as saying ""a glucose test strip changes from yellow to green when glucose is there?""",19.01.2012,02.30.02
466CS9,yes,19.01.2012,02.30.16
488CS9,yes,19.01.2012,02.30.17
473CS9,yup,19.01.2012,02.30.22
473CS9,,19.01.2012,02.30.34
488CS9,??,19.01.2012,02.30.40
TUTOR,"Okay, everyone - let's move on to the last experiment.",19.01.2012,02.30.45
473CS9,okay!,19.01.2012,02.31.01
TUTOR,"In this setup we have glucose solution on the outside, pure water on the inside.",19.01.2012,02.31.06
466CS9,ok,19.01.2012,02.31.06
473CS9,mhmmm,19.01.2012,02.31.15
466CS9,this is boring,19.01.2012,02.31.24
TUTOR,"What changes do you think you'll see in this condition? Agree on a prediction for what you'll observe over time, *and* an explanation that everyone understands.",19.01.2012,02.31.30
466CS9,something will change color,19.01.2012,02.31.50
TUTOR,"Please explain your prediction, 466CS9.",19.01.2012,02.31.54
466CS9,i think the strip will change the color of the water,19.01.2012,02.32.42
TUTOR,"Please continue, 466CS9.",19.01.2012,02.32.46
TUTOR,488CS9 might have something to add to the discussion...,19.01.2012,02.32.52
473CS9,the glucose came in!,19.01.2012,02.33.00
466CS9,WOW,19.01.2012,02.33.09
488CS9,i agree with amon,19.01.2012,02.33.16

466CS9,cnt take a joke,19.01.2012,02.34.44
TUTOR,"Make sure each of you is clear on your team's prediction and explanation, and write it in your worksheet.",19.01.2012,02.35.08
473CS9,The glucose came in and is gonna make it change colors!,19.01.2012,02.35.36
488CS9,i agree,19.01.2012,02.35.43
473CS9,yay,19.01.2012,02.35.48
