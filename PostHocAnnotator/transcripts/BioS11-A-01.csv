TUTOR,joins the room,19.01.2012,08.09.16
TUTOR,"Hi, my name is Sage. I'll be working with you in this activity. Take a minute to introduce yourselves.",19.01.2012,08.09.23
TUTOR,"I won't tell you if you're right or wrong, but I'll give feedback as you discuss things as a team.",19.01.2012,08.10.07
TUTOR,Let's look at a setup which is the opposite of the one we saw earlier - the iodine is now inside and the starch is outside.,19.01.2012,08.10.23
409CS1,ok,19.01.2012,08.10.49
TUTOR,"<< On the whiteboard, you can see a picture of this new setup.",19.01.2012,08.10.50
423CS1,,19.01.2012,08.10.52
TUTOR,<< Here's what happened in this setup over time.,19.01.2012,08.11.03
409CS1,ok,19.01.2012,08.11.19
TUTOR,Notice how the inside and outside environments changed. Why did these changes happen?,19.01.2012,08.11.25
413CS1,yep,19.01.2012,08.11.31
423CS1,sure,19.01.2012,08.11.38
409CS1,the water suck out the iodine,19.01.2012,08.12.05
423CS1,no wayy,19.01.2012,08.12.24
409CS1,wazzz up,19.01.2012,08.12.34
413CS1,surrre,19.01.2012,08.12.52
TUTOR,can you say more about the water and the iodine?,19.01.2012,08.13.00
409CS1,the iodione and water have changed the colot of the sarch and water,19.01.2012,08.13.45
423CS1,goodjob jacob,19.01.2012,08.14.00
423CS1,lolololol,19.01.2012,08.14.04
409CS1,wateves lol,19.01.2012,08.14.12
413CS1,u spelled starch wrong,19.01.2012,08.14.46
413CS1,,19.01.2012,08.14.53
413CS1,,19.01.2012,08.14.54
TUTOR,"Okay, team - in a moment we'll move to another set of experiments.",19.01.2012,08.14.58
409CS1,ok,19.01.2012,08.15.10
TUTOR,"For these experiments, we'll use the same membrane, but with pure water on the outside and a glucose solution on the inside.",19.01.2012,08.15.21
409CS1,no problem,19.01.2012,08.15.37
TUTOR,Discuss the differences between glucose and starch molecules.,19.01.2012,08.15.52
423CS1,it weighes lesss,19.01.2012,08.16.04
TUTOR,does everyone agree with 423CS1?,19.01.2012,08.16.27
413CS1,ya and doesn't change colors,19.01.2012,08.16.44
TUTOR,We'll use the tube weight as an indicator for water movement.,19.01.2012,08.16.44
TUTOR,We'll also use *glucose test strips* to detect glucose in both environments.,19.01.2012,08.16.48
409CS1,the glucose changes to green while the starch changes to purple and no i dont agree with 423CS1,19.01.2012,08.16.53
TUTOR,"<< On the whiteboard, you can see what happened in this setup over time.",19.01.2012,08.17.02
TUTOR,"The results with glucose are different than what you saw with starch - as a team, discuss and agree upon an explanation for these results.",19.01.2012,08.17.27
409CS1,it weighed more in yo face hahahaha,19.01.2012,08.17.28
413CS1,it got heavier,19.01.2012,08.17.30
423CS1,well i know that nowwww,19.01.2012,08.17.42
TUTOR,can anyone add on to what Jacob said?,19.01.2012,08.17.42
409CS1,hahahaahahahaha i win now will someone help me,19.01.2012,08.18.18
423CS1,as the glucose strip sat in the water it asborbed more glucose and got heavier,19.01.2012,08.18.25
409CS1,yes that makes alot of sense,19.01.2012,08.18.39
423CS1,it doesssssssssssssssss,19.01.2012,08.18.47
409CS1,yes very much so lol,19.01.2012,08.19.02
413CS1,or did it asorb more water and got heavier...,19.01.2012,08.19.10
TUTOR,good job guys,19.01.2012,08.19.17
423CS1,go awayy jacob,19.01.2012,08.19.20
409CS1,forget u,19.01.2012,08.19.34
423CS1,hahahaha,19.01.2012,08.19.51
423CS1,ur mad,19.01.2012,08.19.53
409CS1,what did i do and yes i an,19.01.2012,08.20.04
409CS1,,19.01.2012,08.20.04
409CS1,am,19.01.2012,08.20.06
409CS1,thank you tutor man,19.01.2012,08.20.31
423CS1,hahahahahah,19.01.2012,08.20.38
413CS1,ok...,19.01.2012,08.20.38
409CS1,?,19.01.2012,08.20.46
423CS1,what,19.01.2012,08.20.54
TUTOR,"Okay, everyone - let's move on to the last experiment.",19.01.2012,08.21.04
409CS1,aight,19.01.2012,08.21.09
423CS1,okayyyyy,19.01.2012,08.21.22
TUTOR,"In this setup we have glucose solution on the outside, pure water on the inside.",19.01.2012,08.21.25
TUTOR,"What changes do you think you'll see in this condition? Agree on a prediction for what you'll observe over time, *and* an explanation that everyone understands.",19.01.2012,08.21.49
409CS1,the strip will change colors and become lighter or heavier,19.01.2012,08.22.21
423CS1,i dont knoww lol,19.01.2012,08.22.49
TUTOR,can you say more about the color changes?,19.01.2012,08.22.50
413CS1,the water will asorb glucose from the outside,19.01.2012,08.23.01
409CS1,the color will change to either yellow or green from what we have llearned,19.01.2012,08.23.23
423CS1,it turns yellow when theres gluclose in it,19.01.2012,08.23.52
409CS1,wldnt it b green,19.01.2012,08.24.14
TUTOR,does everyone agree with 423CS1?,19.01.2012,08.24.16
413CS1,yellow with no glucose and green with glucose,19.01.2012,08.24.29
409CS1,nope shldnt it b green remeber what we just did,19.01.2012,08.24.34
423CS1,whaaaaaaaaaat,19.01.2012,08.25.10
TUTOR,"Make sure each of you is clear on your team's prediction and explanation, and write it in your worksheet.",19.01.2012,08.25.27
409CS1,the strip wouldnt it turn green?,19.01.2012,08.25.39
TUTOR,"ok, so why does the water absorb the glucose? what happens with molecule movement?",19.01.2012,08.25.41
423CS1,ohhhhhhhhh i get ittttttt,19.01.2012,08.26.01
TUTOR,"All right, we're wrapping up. Thanks, team!",19.01.2012,08.26.11
409CS1,so are they both green,19.01.2012,08.26.32
413CS1,ya sure,19.01.2012,08.27.16
423CS1,no,19.01.2012,08.27.16
409CS1,y not,19.01.2012,08.27.31
413CS1,,19.01.2012,08.27.47
413CS1,,19.01.2012,08.27.50
423CS1,becausseee the one with the glucose in it is green,19.01.2012,08.27.51
423CS1,and when itss out of the solution its yellow',19.01.2012,08.28.06
409CS1,true but y,19.01.2012,08.28.07
409CS1,ok that makes sense now haha,19.01.2012,08.28.25
413CS1,yeah and the one with none is yellow,19.01.2012,08.28.37
409CS1,yes,19.01.2012,08.28.47
423CS1,yayyyyyyy im smart,19.01.2012,08.28.48
409CS1,sure lets go with that,19.01.2012,08.28.58
423CS1,shuttupppp lol,19.01.2012,08.29.29
409CS1,lol sure byeee,19.01.2012,08.29.41
423CS1,ignorantt,19.01.2012,08.29.51
423CS1,leaves the room,19.01.2012,08.33.07
