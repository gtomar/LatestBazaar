TUTOR,"Hi, my name is Sage. I'll be working with you in this activity. Take a minute to introduce yourselves.",23.01.2012,12.45.44
568CN7,hi,23.01.2012,12.45.58
568CN7,tim is bender,23.01.2012,12.46.14
561CN7,my name is tim and i will be working with YOU 2day sage,23.01.2012,12.46.23
TUTOR,"I won't tell you if you're right or wrong, but I'll give feedback as you discuss things as a team.",23.01.2012,12.46.29
569CN7,hi my names massie,23.01.2012,12.46.43
TUTOR,Let's look at a setup which is the opposite of the one we saw earlier - the iodine is now inside and the starch is outside.,23.01.2012,12.46.45
561CN7,LOGAN THE DUSTY BENDER,23.01.2012,12.46.53
TUTOR,nice to meet you guys,23.01.2012,12.47.01
TUTOR,"<< On the whiteboard, you can see a picture of this new setup.",23.01.2012,12.47.11
568CN7,my name is logan and ill be working with you today,23.01.2012,12.47.14
TUTOR,<< Here's what happened in this setup over time.,23.01.2012,12.47.24
561CN7,what happened,23.01.2012,12.47.32
568CN7,when,23.01.2012,12.47.43
TUTOR,Notice how the inside and outside environments changed. Why did these changes happen?,23.01.2012,12.47.46
561CN7,at 2:45,23.01.2012,12.47.52

(hip hop harry),joins the room,23.01.2012,12.48.54
568CN7,tim is a bender and is a cake duster,23.01.2012,12.48.54
(hip hop harry),hi,23.01.2012,12.49.02
TUTOR,I'd love to hear more from Massie,23.01.2012,12.49.07
(hip hop harry),leaves the room,23.01.2012,12.49.09
568CN7,same agreed,23.01.2012,12.49.29
561CN7,yo massie what we spose 2 b doin,23.01.2012,12.49.40
TUTOR,for example you could talk about the movement of starch,23.01.2012,12.49.53
569CN7,b/c the iodine went in b/c it was small inuf but the starch didnt go out b/c the starch is to big,23.01.2012,12.49.54
568CN7,agreed,23.01.2012,12.50.11
568CN7,agreed,23.01.2012,12.50.13
569CN7,tim just anwser what the lady asks bout,23.01.2012,12.50.25
TUTOR,nice explanation massie. does tim g also agree?,23.01.2012,12.50.27
561CN7,we already did it in class,23.01.2012,12.50.27
568CN7,agreed,23.01.2012,12.50.43
561CN7,i dnt wanna anser it,23.01.2012,12.50.44
561CN7,your making my brain hurt,23.01.2012,12.51.03
569CN7,well we r getting graded on this so i would do some thing if i was yu,23.01.2012,12.51.19
TUTOR,"Okay, team - in a moment we'll move to another set of experiments.",23.01.2012,12.51.19
569CN7,k,23.01.2012,12.51.26
568CN7,i think that the iodine moved through the starch due to the molecules,23.01.2012,12.51.32
561CN7,yea lets do it now,23.01.2012,12.51.32
568CN7,k,23.01.2012,12.51.34
TUTOR,"For these experiments, we'll use the same membrane, but with pure water on the outside and a glucose solution on the inside.",23.01.2012,12.51.43
561CN7,are you a teacher,23.01.2012,12.51.54
TUTOR,Discuss the differences between glucose and starch molecules.,23.01.2012,12.52.13
568CN7,you are waying the amount of glucose to see how much mass is lost or gained,23.01.2012,12.52.38
561CN7,glucose is sugar and starch is corn,23.01.2012,12.52.48
TUTOR,We'll use the tube weight as an indicator for water movement.,23.01.2012,12.53.06
TUTOR,We'll also use *glucose test strips* to detect glucose in both environments.,23.01.2012,12.53.10
568CN7,ok,23.01.2012,12.53.11
TUTOR,"<< On the whiteboard, you can see what happened in this setup over time.",23.01.2012,12.53.24
569CN7,i think the glucose is small inuf to get out and when it does it'll get lighter,23.01.2012,12.53.28
TUTOR,"The results with glucose are different than what you saw with starch - as a team, discuss and agree upon an explanation for these results.",23.01.2012,12.53.48
568CN7,the glucose increases as time goes on,23.01.2012,12.53.48
561CN7,u dnt use a lighter 2 get it out massie,23.01.2012,12.53.54
TUTOR,are you saying there is more glucose inside as time goes on??,23.01.2012,12.54.14
568CN7,what are you talking about??? accountable talk,23.01.2012,12.54.15
561CN7,non acountable talk,23.01.2012,12.54.33
568CN7,yes that is what im trying to say,23.01.2012,12.54.43
568CN7,yes tim i would atleast like to do well so participate,23.01.2012,12.55.03
TUTOR,Can you say more about where the glucose is coming from?,23.01.2012,12.55.10
569CN7,well its getting hevear so i was wrong,23.01.2012,12.55.39
561CN7,its coming from the sugar and stuff that makes the sugar,23.01.2012,12.55.44
568CN7,it is being transfered from the strach inside of the molecules,23.01.2012,12.55.58
561CN7,u spelled heavier wrong massie,23.01.2012,12.55.59
568CN7,no one cares tim,23.01.2012,12.56.07
561CN7,logan u cakeduster,23.01.2012,12.56.19
569CN7,i do not care!1',23.01.2012,12.56.26

569CN7,lol;0,23.01.2012,12.56.51
TUTOR,"so if sugar is going out, but the weight is increasing, where does the increase in weight come from?",23.01.2012,12.56.53
568CN7,k sounds good lets get back to work,23.01.2012,12.56.55

TUTOR,"Okay, everyone - let's move on to the last experiment.",23.01.2012,12.57.25
561CN7,aite,23.01.2012,12.57.32
568CN7,it comes from the water left in the molecule,23.01.2012,12.57.37
568CN7,ok,23.01.2012,12.57.44
569CN7,"idk whats going on here, this one is harder",23.01.2012,12.57.45
TUTOR,"In this setup we have glucose solution on the outside, pure water on the inside.",23.01.2012,12.57.46
TUTOR,"What changes do you think you'll see in this condition? Agree on a prediction for what you'll observe over time, *and* an explanation that everyone understands.",23.01.2012,12.58.10
561CN7,,23.01.2012,12.58.40

561CN7,,23.01.2012,12.58.42
568CN7,the glucose will absorb most of the water,23.01.2012,12.59.11
569CN7,i think the glucose will go in to the little bag and make it heavier?,23.01.2012,12.59.26
568CN7,therfore it will weight much more,23.01.2012,12.59.26
TUTOR,nice prediction. who agrees with 568CN7?,23.01.2012,12.59.27
568CN7,agreedBACKSLASH,23.01.2012,12.59.39
569CN7,i agree,23.01.2012,12.59.53
561CN7,i disagree with massie because the glucose is big enough that u can c it,23.01.2012,13.00.04
569CN7,but i thought it was,23.01.2012,13.00.27
568CN7,tim your wrong you need to provide more detail im not understanding,23.01.2012,13.00.39
561CN7,i disagree with massie bcuz the glucose it too big and u can tell by seeing it,23.01.2012,13.00.51
TUTOR,nice challenge tim,23.01.2012,13.00.53
TUTOR,nice challenge 568CN7,23.01.2012,13.01.00

TUTOR,"Make sure each of you is clear on your team's prediction and explanation, and write it in your worksheet.",23.01.2012,13.01.48
TUTOR,Have you guzs discussed your prediction for the weight?,23.01.2012,13.02.02
569CN7,"but the starch was to big to go through, and the glucose went through the last thing we looked at",23.01.2012,13.02.03
568CN7,agreed^,23.01.2012,13.02.13
TUTOR,good reasoning massie,23.01.2012,13.02.17
