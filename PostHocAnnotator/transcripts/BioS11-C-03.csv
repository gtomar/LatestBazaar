TUTOR,"Hi, my name is Sage. I'll be working with you in this activity. Take a minute to introduce yourselves.",19.01.2012,02.17.38
472CS9,i hate gina,19.01.2012,02.18.22
TUTOR,"I won't tell you if you're right or wrong, but I'll give feedback as you discuss things as a team.",19.01.2012,02.18.24
472CS9,gin has a big head,19.01.2012,02.18.35
482CS9,f off -.-,19.01.2012,02.18.37
TUTOR,Let's look at a setup which is the opposite of the one we saw earlier - the iodine is now inside and the starch is outside.,19.01.2012,02.18.39
TUTOR,leaves the room,19.01.2012,02.18.43
481CS9,Hi hanna hi gina!,19.01.2012,02.18.45
472CS9,this is courtney!,19.01.2012,02.18.51
TUTOR,joins the room,19.01.2012,02.19.01
482CS9,Hi Angela !,19.01.2012,02.19.03
472CS9,hi angie!,19.01.2012,02.19.13
TUTOR,"<< On the whiteboard, you can see a picture of this new setup.",19.01.2012,02.19.17
TUTOR,<< Here's what happened in this setup over time.,19.01.2012,02.19.30
TUTOR,Notice how the inside and outside environments changed. Why did these changes happen?,19.01.2012,02.19.52
482CS9,They changed because ... they were put in stravh],19.01.2012,02.20.19
482CS9,starch*,19.01.2012,02.20.22
481CS9,i agree with gina!.,19.01.2012,02.20.49
482CS9,tutor?!c,19.01.2012,02.21.00
482CS9,lol,19.01.2012,02.21.02
472CS9,ok..me too!,19.01.2012,02.21.05
472CS9,angie! hi,19.01.2012,02.21.55
481CS9,what do we do next?.,19.01.2012,02.21.59
482CS9,i don't know..our tutor is missing.,19.01.2012,02.22.14
472CS9,idk..what r we suppose to be doin,19.01.2012,02.22.18
472CS9,tutor where r you...,19.01.2012,02.22.47
482CS9,nfijdfbhjkgf. this is crazy,19.01.2012,02.23.04
472CS9,right!,19.01.2012,02.23.14
TUTOR,"Okay, team - in a moment we'll move to another set of experiments.",19.01.2012,02.23.25
472CS9,here he is!,19.01.2012,02.23.38
TUTOR,"For these experiments, we'll use the same membrane, but with pure water on the outside and a glucose solution on the inside.",19.01.2012,02.23.48
482CS9,"right?! but, i don't know what we're doing..I'm confused.",19.01.2012,02.23.57
481CS9,same here.,19.01.2012,02.24.05
472CS9,me too...,19.01.2012,02.24.15
TUTOR,Discuss the differences between glucose and starch molecules.,19.01.2012,02.24.19
482CS9,glucose and starch are two different liquids.,19.01.2012,02.24.47
472CS9,glucose doesnt do anything and starch changes colors,19.01.2012,02.24.55
482CS9,"agreed with 472CS9,",19.01.2012,02.25.06
472CS9,yay!,19.01.2012,02.25.09
TUTOR,We'll use the tube weight as an indicator for water movement.,19.01.2012,02.25.11
481CS9,they affect things differently.,19.01.2012,02.25.13
TUTOR,We'll also use *glucose test strips* to detect glucose in both environments.,19.01.2012,02.25.15
TUTOR,"<< On the whiteboard, you can see what happened in this setup over time.",19.01.2012,02.25.29
482CS9,okay...,19.01.2012,02.25.44
TUTOR,"The results with glucose are different than what you saw with starch - as a team, discuss and agree upon an explanation for these results.",19.01.2012,02.25.54
472CS9,8=D,19.01.2012,02.25.56
472CS9,that was courtney,19.01.2012,02.26.09
481CS9,the glucose got heavier instead of getting lighter,19.01.2012,02.26.33
482CS9,"over time, the distliled water made the bag inflame more, and theres more glucose in the bag",19.01.2012,02.26.44
472CS9,the tubes changed colors,19.01.2012,02.26.56
481CS9,smart way to word it gina. i agree with you!.,19.01.2012,02.27.05
TUTOR,so are you saying the water diffused into the bag?,19.01.2012,02.27.10
TUTOR,"Good job on using your accountable talk moves, Angela",19.01.2012,02.27.33
482CS9,no not nesscarily. i just think that the water help affect the bag.,19.01.2012,02.27.56
TUTOR,can someone say more about that? Hannah?,19.01.2012,02.28.18
472CS9,,19.01.2012,02.28.28
472CS9,ummmmm....,19.01.2012,02.28.35
482CS9,"i think that she means that the more time the bag is in the water, it has more glucose affect to it",19.01.2012,02.29.03
472CS9,ya thats it!,19.01.2012,02.29.14
482CS9,so that's why the test strps are different colors,19.01.2012,02.29.19
472CS9,i agree with gina,19.01.2012,02.29.28
TUTOR,"Okay, everyone - let's move on to the last experiment.",19.01.2012,02.29.31
TUTOR,"In this setup we have glucose solution on the outside, pure water on the inside.",19.01.2012,02.29.52
482CS9,okay,19.01.2012,02.30.00
TUTOR,"What changes do you think you'll see in this condition? Agree on a prediction for what you'll observe over time, *and* an explanation that everyone understands.",19.01.2012,02.30.16
482CS9,i think that the glucose strip isn't getting affect at all,19.01.2012,02.31.23
482CS9,i have no clue why it's cjhanging colors though..,19.01.2012,02.31.39
TUTOR,So are you saying it won't change colors but you don't know why?,19.01.2012,02.32.14
482CS9,yeah',19.01.2012,02.32.20
TUTOR,Who can help 482CS9,19.01.2012,02.32.29
TUTOR,Angela?,19.01.2012,02.32.39
481CS9,it didnt change colors because there is no glucose in the distilled water,19.01.2012,02.33.04
472CS9,i agree with angela,19.01.2012,02.33.27
482CS9,"yeah, so do i. the glucose makes majoirty of the changes, I agree",19.01.2012,02.33.47
TUTOR,"Make sure each of you is clear on your team's prediction and explanation, and write it in your worksheet.",19.01.2012,02.33.54
472CS9,yes i agree with that i dnt think the water has any affect,19.01.2012,02.34.05
481CS9,so wait. what is our prediction?.,19.01.2012,02.34.18
482CS9,"that since their is no glucose in the water, the strip doesn't have an affect",19.01.2012,02.34.35
TUTOR,"All right, we're wrapping up. Thanks, team!",19.01.2012,02.34.38
TUTOR,So is 482CS9 saying the water can't move out of the tube?,19.01.2012,02.35.01
482CS9,It can't.,19.01.2012,02.35.23
481CS9,so the weight will stay the same and the color of the strip?.,19.01.2012,02.35.49
482CS9,i don't know. i'm confused !,19.01.2012,02.36.29
472CS9,mee too!,19.01.2012,02.36.44
TUTOR,Who can say why it's different from condition C?,19.01.2012,02.37.19
472CS9,thanks for keeping me updated guys!! remember im in ur group! haha,19.01.2012,02.38.09
482CS9,lol sorry.! but. so what are we saying?,19.01.2012,02.38.53
472CS9,idk u guys were tlkin instead of typing,19.01.2012,02.39.09
481CS9,okay so the tube is green because it is in the glucose but when it is yellow it is saying that there is no glucose in the distilled water,19.01.2012,02.39.25
482CS9,thanks angela ! i agree!,19.01.2012,02.39.35
472CS9,thats the prediction?,19.01.2012,02.39.49
482CS9,ya,19.01.2012,02.39.54
472CS9,oh ok haha,19.01.2012,02.39.58
481CS9,leaves the room,19.01.2012,02.40.47
482CS9,leaves the room,19.01.2012,02.40.59
472CS9,leaves the room,19.01.2012,02.41.38
TUTOR,leaves the room,19.01.2012,04.58.56
