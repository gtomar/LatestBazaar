462CS9,that was courtney i swear,19.01.2012,02.22.03
TUTOR,joins the room,19.01.2012,02.22.22
TUTOR,"Hi, my name is Sage. I'll be working with you in this activity. Take a minute to introduce yourselves.",19.01.2012,02.22.28
475CS9,my name is tori sage,19.01.2012,02.22.40
475CS9,hello,19.01.2012,02.22.44
462CS9,wow u got it in?,19.01.2012,02.22.57
462CS9,married much,19.01.2012,02.23.00
479CS9,my name is joe,19.01.2012,02.23.03
TUTOR,"I won't tell you if you're right or wrong, but I'll give feedback as you discuss things as a team.",19.01.2012,02.23.13
TUTOR,Let's look at a setup which is the opposite of the one we saw earlier - the iodine is now inside and the starch is outside.,19.01.2012,02.23.29
462CS9,My name is Brandon,19.01.2012,02.23.34
TUTOR,"<< On the whiteboard, you can see a picture of this new setup.",19.01.2012,02.23.55
TUTOR,<< Here's what happened in this setup over time.,19.01.2012,02.24.08
TUTOR,Notice how the inside and outside environments changed. Why did these changes happen?,19.01.2012,02.24.30
462CS9,it sucked the iodine in,19.01.2012,02.25.12
479CS9,i think the starch,19.01.2012,02.25.13
479CS9,,19.01.2012,02.25.13
479CS9,,19.01.2012,02.25.13
479CS9,,19.01.2012,02.25.13
TUTOR,Ok,19.01.2012,02.25.15
462CS9,i like hanna,19.01.2012,02.25.48
462CS9,what noooo,19.01.2012,02.25.50
462CS9,that was someone else,19.01.2012,02.25.57
479CS9,the starch water was pulling out the iodine from that so it whent in the watter,19.01.2012,02.26.19
462CS9,i agree,19.01.2012,02.27.10
479CS9,so we all agree,19.01.2012,02.27.45
TUTOR,"Okay, team - in a moment we'll move to another set of experiments.",19.01.2012,02.28.03
479CS9,k,19.01.2012,02.28.11
475CS9,helllooo,19.01.2012,02.28.26
TUTOR,"For these experiments, we'll use the same membrane, but with pure water on the outside and a glucose solution on the inside.",19.01.2012,02.28.27
462CS9,hi tori,19.01.2012,02.28.43
TUTOR,Discuss the differences between glucose and starch molecules.,19.01.2012,02.28.57
462CS9,glucose test strip wil change after a while,19.01.2012,02.29.26
TUTOR,We'll use the tube weight as an indicator for water movement.,19.01.2012,02.29.50
TUTOR,We'll also use *glucose test strips* to detect glucose in both environments.,19.01.2012,02.29.53
TUTOR,"<< On the whiteboard, you can see what happened in this setup over time.",19.01.2012,02.30.08
462CS9,ok,19.01.2012,02.30.08
462CS9,it turned green,19.01.2012,02.30.20
TUTOR,"The results with glucose are different than what you saw with starch - as a team, discuss and agree upon an explanation for these results.",19.01.2012,02.30.32
475CS9,it got darker as the hours increased,19.01.2012,02.30.34
479CS9,i agree with that,19.01.2012,02.30.44
462CS9,darker (greener),19.01.2012,02.30.53
475CS9,the weight incresed,19.01.2012,02.31.17
462CS9,as the hours went passed the weight incresed and it changed colors,19.01.2012,02.31.34
479CS9,i agree with that,19.01.2012,02.31.45
475CS9,same,19.01.2012,02.31.51
462CS9,what's next sage?,19.01.2012,02.32.23
479CS9,so we all agree on that,19.01.2012,02.32.49
462CS9,yes,19.01.2012,02.32.53
475CS9,yes,19.01.2012,02.32.54
TUTOR,"Okay, everyone - let's move on to the last experiment.",19.01.2012,02.34.09
TUTOR,"In this setup we have glucose solution on the outside, pure water on the inside.",19.01.2012,02.34.30
462CS9,ok,19.01.2012,02.34.45
TUTOR,"What changes do you think you'll see in this condition? Agree on a prediction for what you'll observe over time, *and* an explanation that everyone understands.",19.01.2012,02.34.54
462CS9,the test strip will change colors and it will weigh more,19.01.2012,02.35.22
TUTOR,"Thanks for starting a prediction, 462CS9.",19.01.2012,02.35.26
479CS9,yes i agree with that,19.01.2012,02.35.40
462CS9,:),19.01.2012,02.35.53
475CS9,i think the green clucose strip is going to get yellow and weigh more,19.01.2012,02.36.08
TUTOR,"Thanks for starting a prediction, 475CS9.",19.01.2012,02.36.12
462CS9,"i agree i think we should write that for ""D""",19.01.2012,02.36.46
475CS9,yeaah ?,19.01.2012,02.37.12
462CS9,why the ? mark,19.01.2012,02.37.22
475CS9,iddk,19.01.2012,02.37.27
462CS9,ok then :),19.01.2012,02.37.35
TUTOR,"Make sure each of you is clear on your team's prediction and explanation, and write it in your worksheet.",19.01.2012,02.38.32
462CS9,we all agree with 475CS9,19.01.2012,02.39.11
TUTOR,"All right, we're wrapping up. Thanks, team!",19.01.2012,02.39.16
475CS9,leaves the room,19.01.2012,02.39.55
462CS9,YAY we finished time to go home :) :) : ) :) :) :),19.01.2012,02.40.00
