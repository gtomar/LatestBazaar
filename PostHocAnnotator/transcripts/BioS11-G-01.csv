TUTOR,"Hi, my name is Sage. I'll be working with you in this activity. Take a minute to introduce yourselves.",23.01.2012,12.45.10
564CN7,hi,23.01.2012,12.45.17
564CN7,hi katie,23.01.2012,12.45.47
566CN7,HEY,23.01.2012,12.45.54
TUTOR,"I won't tell you if you're right or wrong, but I'll give feedback as you discuss things as a team.",23.01.2012,12.45.55
TUTOR,Let's look at a setup which is the opposite of the one we saw earlier - the iodine is now inside and the starch is outside.,23.01.2012,12.46.11
TUTOR,"<< On the whiteboard, you can see a picture of this new setup.",23.01.2012,12.46.37
TUTOR,<< Here's what happened in this setup over time.,23.01.2012,12.46.50
TUTOR,Notice how the inside and outside environments changed. Why did these changes happen?,23.01.2012,12.47.12
566CN7,the iodine went through the startch,23.01.2012,12.47.19
564CN7,that is true,23.01.2012,12.47.41
TUTOR,... okay,23.01.2012,12.47.45
566CN7,then the iodine turned the stratch blue,23.01.2012,12.48.17
TUTOR,"Would another way to say that be ""when iodine and starch mix, they turn purple?""",23.01.2012,12.48.22
566CN7,yeah,23.01.2012,12.48.33
553CN7,yes because it is the chemical reaction of the iodine and the starch meeting,23.01.2012,12.48.56
TUTOR,"Keep on explaining, 553CN7.",23.01.2012,12.49.00
553CN7,molecules,23.01.2012,12.50.06
564CN7,its timmy !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,23.01.2012,12.50.11
TUTOR,"Okay, team - in a moment we'll move to another set of experiments.",23.01.2012,12.50.45
566CN7,the idone mixed with the startch because the molecules were small enough to fit through the poors in the plastic bag but the startch molecules were to big,23.01.2012,12.50.50
TUTOR,"For these experiments, we'll use the same membrane, but with pure water on the outside and a glucose solution on the inside.",23.01.2012,12.51.09
TUTOR,Discuss the differences between glucose and starch molecules.,23.01.2012,12.51.39
566CN7,the startch has gluclose but the iodine does not BACKSLASH,23.01.2012,12.52.29
TUTOR,We'll use the tube weight as an indicator for water movement.,23.01.2012,12.52.32
TUTOR,We'll also use *glucose test strips* to detect glucose in both environments.,23.01.2012,12.52.36
TUTOR,"<< On the whiteboard, you can see what happened in this setup over time.",23.01.2012,12.52.50
TUTOR,"The results with glucose are different than what you saw with starch - as a team, discuss and agree upon an explanation for these results.",23.01.2012,12.53.14
566CN7,when the iodine mixed with the starch it created glucose,23.01.2012,12.53.29
553CN7,wasn't there already glucose there though?,23.01.2012,12.54.04
566CN7,im not sure i think there was in the starch but not the iodine],23.01.2012,12.54.37
TUTOR,"Please explain your prediction, 566CN7.",23.01.2012,12.54.41
566CN7,there wasnt any glucose in the iodine but when it mixeddw ith the startch there was,23.01.2012,12.55.40
TUTOR,"Would another way to say that be ""the glucose strip and the iodine are both used as indicators?""",23.01.2012,12.55.45
566CN7,i guess,23.01.2012,12.55.56
553CN7,but when you look at the glucose strip for the initial observation there is already a little bit of glucose present. and as the time goes on the color darkens so wouldn't it be fair to say that the amount of glucose increased?,23.01.2012,12.56.13
TUTOR,"Okay, everyone - let's move on to the last experiment.",23.01.2012,12.56.51
TUTOR,"In this setup we have glucose solution on the outside, pure water on the inside.",23.01.2012,12.57.13
TUTOR,"What changes do you think you'll see in this condition? Agree on a prediction for what you'll observe over time, *and* an explanation that everyone understands.",23.01.2012,12.57.36
566CN7,yeah it creaced after time went on and more glucose moved through the strip,23.01.2012,12.57.49
566CN7,i think after time goes by glucose wont enter ther distilled water,23.01.2012,12.59.30
553CN7,maybe you'll see that the color of the strip changes because the glucose passes through the membrane of the cell therefore decreasing the amount outside and leaving little to none for the indicator to pick up,23.01.2012,12.59.30
TUTOR,"Thanks for starting a prediction, 566CN7.",23.01.2012,12.59.34
TUTOR,"Maybe you could state that as ""the glucose can pass through the cell membrane.""",23.01.2012,12.59.40
553CN7,yeah you could say that,23.01.2012,13.00.03
TUTOR,I wonder what 564CN7 has to say.,23.01.2012,13.00.24
566CN7,would that be our explanation ?,23.01.2012,13.00.28
553CN7,lets see what sam has to say first then we'll get an explaination,23.01.2012,13.01.06
TUTOR,"Make sure each of you is clear on your team's prediction and explanation, and write it in your worksheet.",23.01.2012,13.01.14
TUTOR,"All right, we're wrapping up. Thanks, team!",23.01.2012,13.01.58
566CN7,sam do you agree and dont say yes because you just want to be done and do no work !,23.01.2012,13.02.10
553CN7,haha well do you think that is the predicton noel?,23.01.2012,13.02.34
566CN7,yeah i belive so,23.01.2012,13.02.43
564CN7,i agree,23.01.2012,13.02.47
566CN7,believe,23.01.2012,13.02.51
553CN7,then let's just right that the glucose will pass through the cell mambrane..?,23.01.2012,13.03.11
553CN7,write*,23.01.2012,13.03.22
566CN7,okay .,23.01.2012,13.03.23
564CN7,what do u think the predictions after 24 hours will be,23.01.2012,13.04.29
566CN7,leaves the room,23.01.2012,13.04.40
553CN7,i'm not sure,23.01.2012,13.04.54
564CN7,ok,23.01.2012,13.04.58
564CN7,leaves the room,23.01.2012,13.05.16
553CN7,leaves the room,23.01.2012,13.19.24
