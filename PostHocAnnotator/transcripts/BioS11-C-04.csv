476CS9,Sarahhhhhh!!!!,19.01.2012,02.18.33
TUTOR,Let's look at a setup which is the opposite of the one we saw earlier - the iodine is now inside and the starch is outside.,19.01.2012,02.18.40
TUTOR,leaves the room,19.01.2012,02.18.44

476CS9,awee poor ugly thing,19.01.2012,02.20.14
TUTOR,<< Here's what happened in this setup over time.,19.01.2012,02.20.15
469CS9,Haha. your fish is back from the dead and hes talking to you.,19.01.2012,02.20.35
TUTOR,Notice how the inside and outside environments changed. Why did these changes happen?,19.01.2012,02.20.37
486CS9,idk what to do guys,19.01.2012,02.21.20
476CS9,me either!!!,19.01.2012,02.21.30

486CS9,we do write on the paper,19.01.2012,02.23.52
469CS9,Haha. what did jesus say to do?,19.01.2012,02.23.59
476CS9,These changes happen because the iodine changes it,19.01.2012,02.24.03
TUTOR,"Okay, team - in a moment we'll move to another set of experiments.",19.01.2012,02.24.10
469CS9,okay thanx,19.01.2012,02.24.15
476CS9,he said yes we could write on the paper if we wanna,19.01.2012,02.24.23
469CS9,8=====D,19.01.2012,02.24.30
TUTOR,"For these experiments, we'll use the same membrane, but with pure water on the outside and a glucose solution on the inside.",19.01.2012,02.24.34
469CS9,Hahah,19.01.2012,02.24.36
476CS9,the iodine gets inside the starch,19.01.2012,02.24.50
486CS9,lmao he was right next to me when you made that sarah!!,19.01.2012,02.24.56
TUTOR,Discuss the differences between glucose and starch molecules.,19.01.2012,02.25.04
476CS9,lol,19.01.2012,02.25.07
486CS9,he said we only do D,19.01.2012,02.25.22
TUTOR,We'll use the tube weight as an indicator for water movement.,19.01.2012,02.25.57
TUTOR,We'll also use *glucose test strips* to detect glucose in both environments.,19.01.2012,02.26.00
TUTOR,"<< On the whiteboard, you can see what happened in this setup over time.",19.01.2012,02.26.15
476CS9,the difference between the glocose and the starch is that glocose is different kinds of sugar bt the starch is basically food,19.01.2012,02.26.16
TUTOR,"The results with glucose are different than what you saw with starch - as a team, discuss and agree upon an explanation for these results.",19.01.2012,02.26.39
486CS9,we only have like 20 mins left :p,19.01.2012,02.27.36
486CS9,"so as soon as condition D comes up, we have to pay attention",19.01.2012,02.27.56
469CS9,Okay 0_o,19.01.2012,02.28.16
476CS9,but he said we shuld juss b discussing,19.01.2012,02.28.32
486CS9,about what? the other problems?,19.01.2012,02.28.58
476CS9,glocose got heavier instead of gettin lighter,19.01.2012,02.29.27
476CS9,idk,19.01.2012,02.29.34
476CS9,ask jesus,19.01.2012,02.29.43
469CS9,I think your right,19.01.2012,02.30.10
TUTOR,"Okay, everyone - let's move on to the last experiment.",19.01.2012,02.30.16
476CS9,okay,19.01.2012,02.30.22
486CS9,here comes D,19.01.2012,02.30.23
476CS9,lol,19.01.2012,02.30.32
TUTOR,"In this setup we have glucose solution on the outside, pure water on the inside.",19.01.2012,02.30.37
TUTOR,"What changes do you think you'll see in this condition? Agree on a prediction for what you'll observe over time, *and* an explanation that everyone understands.",19.01.2012,02.31.01
486CS9,"I think it might get lighter, since int he other experiments it also got lighter",19.01.2012,02.31.50
486CS9,in the*,19.01.2012,02.31.57
469CS9,Yeah i think it does get lighter,19.01.2012,02.32.16
476CS9,i agree,19.01.2012,02.32.24
486CS9,now we need to write down our hyothesis on our papers,19.01.2012,02.32.45
476CS9,i think it will continue on gettin lighter,19.01.2012,02.32.49
476CS9,i dont have a pencil,19.01.2012,02.33.01
486CS9,do we believe the package will get lighter?,19.01.2012,02.33.12
486CS9,the water bag i meant :p,19.01.2012,02.33.37
476CS9,also it didnt change colors because there is no glocose in the distiled water,19.01.2012,02.34.08
469CS9,It might get heavier because the sugar might get inside it. but im not sure.,19.01.2012,02.34.15
TUTOR,"So is 469CS9 saying ""the tube gets heavier if water flows in but not out?""",19.01.2012,02.34.20
476CS9,yes,19.01.2012,02.34.31
TUTOR,"Make sure each of you is clear on your team's prediction and explanation, and write it in your worksheet.",19.01.2012,02.34.39
476CS9,okay.,19.01.2012,02.35.00
TUTOR,"All right, we're wrapping up. Thanks, team!",19.01.2012,02.35.23
476CS9,your welcome.,19.01.2012,02.35.34
469CS9,What are u guys gona wright for D?,19.01.2012,02.35.53
476CS9,i think it will b the same for the prediction as the fist observation,19.01.2012,02.36.17
476CS9,same as the first observation down on condition d,19.01.2012,02.36.50
486CS9,"i wrote...'We believe the distilled water will decrease in time, but we are still undecided because since there is sugar involoved, it might get inside. But overall we believe by 24 hours it will increse in weight.""",19.01.2012,02.37.12
486CS9,derease*****,19.01.2012,02.37.28
476CS9,i agree,19.01.2012,02.37.44
469CS9,Me 2,19.01.2012,02.38.03
486CS9,leaves the room,19.01.2012,02.39.29
476CS9,i wrote that in my own words,19.01.2012,02.39.31
476CS9,leaves the room,19.01.2012,02.39.34
469CS9,leaves the room,19.01.2012,02.42.08
TUTOR,leaves the room,19.01.2012,04.58.48
