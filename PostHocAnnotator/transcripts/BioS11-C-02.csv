485CS9,I'm Bobby! :),19.01.2012,02.18.34
TUTOR,Let's look at a setup which is the opposite of the one we saw earlier - the iodine is now inside and the starch is outside.,19.01.2012,02.18.37
TUTOR,leaves the room,19.01.2012,02.18.42

TUTOR,"<< On the whiteboard, you can see a picture of this new setup.",19.01.2012,02.20.11
463CS9,Oooooh a picture,19.01.2012,02.20.13
471CS9,yes,19.01.2012,02.20.17
TUTOR,<< Here's what happened in this setup over time.,19.01.2012,02.20.24
485CS9,Thank you Kelly.! :D More pictures!,19.01.2012,02.20.39
TUTOR,Notice how the inside and outside environments changed. Why did these changes happen?,19.01.2012,02.20.46
471CS9,(: anytime anytime,19.01.2012,02.20.55
471CS9,the iodine detected starch,19.01.2012,02.21.12
485CS9,Kelly took my answer.. :/,19.01.2012,02.21.33
463CS9,I believe the iodine came in contact with the starch.,19.01.2012,02.21.38
471CS9,sorry):,19.01.2012,02.21.40
471CS9,nick sounds all smart,19.01.2012,02.21.48
485CS9,All good.! :),19.01.2012,02.21.53
463CS9,Eeeeeyup xD,19.01.2012,02.22.15
485CS9,"Once upon a time, there was a ginger named courtney..",19.01.2012,02.22.40
463CS9,Lol,19.01.2012,02.22.56
471CS9,ahaha she lived in a world with no other gingers except angie(:,19.01.2012,02.23.06
485CS9,But in Courtney's eyes angie was a LAME!,19.01.2012,02.23.28
471CS9,angies not a lame!,19.01.2012,02.23.42
485CS9,I know. Shes blue! <3,19.01.2012,02.23.58
471CS9,shes not a smurff?,19.01.2012,02.24.09
463CS9,xD,19.01.2012,02.24.10
485CS9,Says you..,19.01.2012,02.24.18
TUTOR,"Okay, team - in a moment we'll move to another set of experiments.",19.01.2012,02.24.19
471CS9,okay thats cool(:,19.01.2012,02.24.30
463CS9,kk~,19.01.2012,02.24.37
485CS9,Okay sir!,19.01.2012,02.24.38
TUTOR,"For these experiments, we'll use the same membrane, but with pure water on the outside and a glucose solution on the inside.",19.01.2012,02.24.43
485CS9,Kelly!,19.01.2012,02.24.43
485CS9,Kelly!,19.01.2012,02.24.49
471CS9,what?!,19.01.2012,02.24.53
485CS9,Hi. :). hehe,19.01.2012,02.25.00
471CS9,haha hi(:,19.01.2012,02.25.07
TUTOR,Discuss the differences between glucose and starch molecules.,19.01.2012,02.25.13
463CS9,I have a feeling the Sage is a bot or something... not a real person...,19.01.2012,02.25.27
471CS9,glucose molecules are less dense than starch molecules,19.01.2012,02.25.47
485CS9,Starch molecules are fat.,19.01.2012,02.26.02
TUTOR,We'll use the tube weight as an indicator for water movement.,19.01.2012,02.26.06
TUTOR,We'll also use *glucose test strips* to detect glucose in both environments.,19.01.2012,02.26.09
TUTOR,"<< On the whiteboard, you can see what happened in this setup over time.",19.01.2012,02.26.24
TUTOR,"The results with glucose are different than what you saw with starch - as a team, discuss and agree upon an explanation for these results.",19.01.2012,02.26.48
485CS9,"Kelly, am I taller than you? because you were always taller by an inch back in the day.",19.01.2012,02.27.00
471CS9,"in the first one there was no glucose, in the second one there is little glucose and in the last one there was a lot",19.01.2012,02.27.44
463CS9,um... I'm thinking... but Im not sure,19.01.2012,02.27.52
471CS9,and bobby i think we are almost the same height!,19.01.2012,02.28.01
485CS9,agreed. Kelly stole my answer again. And We are the same height because we're awesome.,19.01.2012,02.28.50
471CS9,or over time it changed the color of the strip so the glucose could seep out,19.01.2012,02.29.16
471CS9,oh you know it(:,19.01.2012,02.29.25
485CS9,yup :),19.01.2012,02.29.36
471CS9,(: yay!,19.01.2012,02.29.59
485CS9,:) yipee. lol,19.01.2012,02.30.13
TUTOR,"Okay, everyone - let's move on to the last experiment.",19.01.2012,02.30.25
463CS9,Hmm... I agree with Kelly~ I couldn't think of any other way to put it. :P,19.01.2012,02.30.26
TUTOR,"In this setup we have glucose solution on the outside, pure water on the inside.",19.01.2012,02.30.46
471CS9,thats cause im smart(:,19.01.2012,02.30.51
485CS9,yes kelly we know. :),19.01.2012,02.31.05
TUTOR,"What changes do you think you'll see in this condition? Agree on a prediction for what you'll observe over time, *and* an explanation that everyone understands.",19.01.2012,02.31.10
485CS9,Okay so predictions for Strip color inside:,19.01.2012,02.31.51
485CS9,Strip color outside;,19.01.2012,02.32.01
471CS9,inside what the bag?,19.01.2012,02.32.05
463CS9,"I think the water would ""water down' the glucose. Getting rid of some of it, making the strip go lighter.",19.01.2012,02.32.22
463CS9,"Sort of when ice melts in soda, it waters it down... getting rid of the sweet sugary taste.",19.01.2012,02.32.54
471CS9,oh i think the strip color inside will turn light green and the strip outside will turn lighter to a yellow like nick said,19.01.2012,02.32.59
485CS9,:0 nick your brilliant!,19.01.2012,02.33.14
471CS9,right!,19.01.2012,02.33.24
463CS9,Thank you. ^_^,19.01.2012,02.33.31
471CS9,ok i agree with what nick said. do we all agree with the colors that i said?,19.01.2012,02.33.56
485CS9,I do.,19.01.2012,02.34.12
463CS9,Eeeeyup,19.01.2012,02.34.17
471CS9,or do you think the colors will be different? im not 100% sure,19.01.2012,02.34.20
485CS9,"No, I think your prediction sounds accurate.",19.01.2012,02.34.46
TUTOR,"Make sure each of you is clear on your team's prediction and explanation, and write it in your worksheet.",19.01.2012,02.34.48
471CS9,mkay,19.01.2012,02.34.54
471CS9,what about the weight?,19.01.2012,02.35.04
463CS9,So... does someone want to sum it all up?,19.01.2012,02.35.13
485CS9,About to ask the same thing..,19.01.2012,02.35.21
463CS9,"Oh, I think the weight will be lighter than the original",19.01.2012,02.35.24
TUTOR,"All right, we're wrapping up. Thanks, team!",19.01.2012,02.35.32
463CS9,Since water is less dense than glucose,19.01.2012,02.35.39
485CS9,But What exact weight>,19.01.2012,02.35.56
463CS9,wait no... I'm not sure about that... :l,19.01.2012,02.36.10
471CS9,it would be less dense after the glucose so i think it would be about .50g?,19.01.2012,02.36.58
485CS9,Sounds right.,19.01.2012,02.37.14
471CS9,mkay.,19.01.2012,02.37.21
463CS9,Sounds pretty accurate...,19.01.2012,02.37.27
471CS9,yay! good job team(:,19.01.2012,02.37.38

471CS9,#teampink!,19.01.2012,02.38.12
463CS9,lol. what do we put for Strip Color inside and Strip Color Outside?,19.01.2012,02.38.15
471CS9,strip color inside:light green,19.01.2012,02.38.28
471CS9,strip color outside:yellow,19.01.2012,02.38.36
463CS9,K thanks~,19.01.2012,02.38.44

463CS9,waaaaait,19.01.2012,02.39.00
463CS9,the glucose is outside... meaning it would be darker on the outside,19.01.2012,02.39.20
463CS9,so wouldn't it be lighter on the inside?,19.01.2012,02.39.34
471CS9,idk,19.01.2012,02.39.36
471CS9,idk?,19.01.2012,02.39.48
485CS9,Lets stick with what we have.,19.01.2012,02.39.50
