452CS7,joins the room,19.01.2012,12.42.55
446CS7,hi,19.01.2012,12.43.11
452CS7,Hi,19.01.2012,12.43.19
446CS7,i got lost,19.01.2012,12.43.29
452CS7,how?,19.01.2012,12.43.34
446CS7,they said libary so i went there,19.01.2012,12.43.49
448CS7,wow 446CS7,19.01.2012,12.43.52
452CS7,ahahah,19.01.2012,12.43.55
448CS7,we told you to come here,19.01.2012,12.44.01
446CS7,i almost didnt come,19.01.2012,12.44.07
452CS7,i wuldnt of,19.01.2012,12.44.13
448CS7,i dont know what to do,19.01.2012,12.44.51
452CS7,loomk at eeryone elses screen,19.01.2012,12.45.10
448CS7,i still dont know,19.01.2012,12.45.27
446CS7,i no we dnt have toutur,19.01.2012,12.45.34
448CS7,i know :/,19.01.2012,12.45.59
TUTOR,joins the room,19.01.2012,12.46.07
TUTOR,"Hi, my name is Sage. I'll be working with you in this activity. Take a minute to introduce yourselves.",19.01.2012,12.46.14
446CS7,446CS7 the one in brown,19.01.2012,12.46.30
448CS7,446CS7 its noone in the room,19.01.2012,12.46.44
452CS7,im landon,19.01.2012,12.46.59
446CS7,ohh,19.01.2012,12.46.59
TUTOR,"I won't tell you if you're right or wrong, but I'll give feedback as you discuss things as a team.",19.01.2012,12.46.59
446CS7,kk leggo,19.01.2012,12.47.08
448CS7,hahaha,19.01.2012,12.47.14
TUTOR,Let's look at a setup which is the opposite of the one we saw earlier - the iodine is now inside and the starch is outside.,19.01.2012,12.47.15
TUTOR,"<< On the whiteboard, you can see a picture of this new setup.",19.01.2012,12.47.41
446CS7,k next,19.01.2012,12.47.49
TUTOR,<< Here's what happened in this setup over time.,19.01.2012,12.47.54
448CS7,over time the weight decreases,19.01.2012,12.48.15
448CS7,,19.01.2012,12.48.16
TUTOR,Notice how the inside and outside environments changed. Why did these changes happen?,19.01.2012,12.48.16
446CS7,the starch changed colors n the packet got lighter,19.01.2012,12.48.42
448CS7,i agree,19.01.2012,12.48.53
452CS7,the starch is in the outside and not in the tube dis time,19.01.2012,12.49.01
446CS7,landon im confused,19.01.2012,12.49.18
448CS7,what?,19.01.2012,12.49.19
448CS7,me too,19.01.2012,12.49.23
446CS7,.,19.01.2012,12.49.31
452CS7,+like the iodine and water is in the tube but the starch is outdside of it cuz that turned purple not the tube,19.01.2012,12.50.00
TUTOR,"Keep on explaining, 452CS7.",19.01.2012,12.50.03
448CS7,the starch is the packet thing?,19.01.2012,12.50.28
448CS7,or what is the starch?,19.01.2012,12.50.45
452CS7,no its outside of it because that what turned purple,19.01.2012,12.50.48
TUTOR,"Thanks for that, 448CS7. Can anyone respond?",19.01.2012,12.50.49
446CS7,so how did the out side change if the iodine didnt actully touch the starch?,19.01.2012,12.50.51
TUTOR,I'd love to hear more from 452CS7...,19.01.2012,12.50.54
452CS7,ok the starch is the outside because thats what turned purple,19.01.2012,12.51.24
TUTOR,"Keep on explaining, 452CS7.",19.01.2012,12.51.28
448CS7,ohhhh ok,19.01.2012,12.51.36
446CS7,but the iodine did not actully touch the starch,19.01.2012,12.51.49
TUTOR,"Okay, team - in a moment we'll move to another set of experiments.",19.01.2012,12.51.49
452CS7,it dont gtta,19.01.2012,12.51.57
448CS7,ok,19.01.2012,12.52.07
TUTOR,"For these experiments, we'll use the same membrane, but with pure water on the outside and a glucose solution on the inside.",19.01.2012,12.52.13
TUTOR,Discuss the differences between glucose and starch molecules.,19.01.2012,12.52.43
452CS7,they have the same qualities since they both can move thru the tube to the outside,19.01.2012,12.53.16
448CS7,well i know that starch molecules forms in water,19.01.2012,12.53.19
TUTOR,"Thanks for offering an explanation, 452CS7 :-)",19.01.2012,12.53.20
TUTOR,We'll use the tube weight as an indicator for water movement.,19.01.2012,12.53.36
TUTOR,We'll also use *glucose test strips* to detect glucose in both environments.,19.01.2012,12.53.40
TUTOR,"<< On the whiteboard, you can see what happened in this setup over time.",19.01.2012,12.53.54
446CS7,its gaining weight,19.01.2012,12.54.16
TUTOR,"The results with glucose are different than what you saw with starch - as a team, discuss and agree upon an explanation for these results.",19.01.2012,12.54.18
448CS7,ohh ok so the glucose increases and teh weight gets heavier,19.01.2012,12.54.19
448CS7,*the,19.01.2012,12.54.37
452CS7,it increased overtime because the glucose seeped thru the tube into the stilled water,19.01.2012,12.54.40
TUTOR,It's nice that you're explaining your reasoning.,19.01.2012,12.54.43
448CS7,ohh ok thanks for explaining landon,19.01.2012,12.55.08
446CS7,im a slight bit confused,19.01.2012,12.55.31
448CS7,what are you confused about?,19.01.2012,12.56.05
452CS7,wait since it weighs more the glucose sucked up water??,19.01.2012,12.56.11
TUTOR,"Thanks for offering an explanation, 452CS7 :-)",19.01.2012,12.56.15
446CS7,how the contints of the package r mixn with the water,19.01.2012,12.56.38
448CS7,yes landon the water decreased because of the glucose,19.01.2012,12.56.46
TUTOR,"Keep on explaining, 448CS7.",19.01.2012,12.56.50
446CS7,is it like leekin thru the package,19.01.2012,12.56.51
TUTOR,I wonder what 446CS7 has to say.,19.01.2012,12.56.57
448CS7,it like seeps through,19.01.2012,12.57.06
448CS7,i assume,19.01.2012,12.57.10
452CS7,not like a leek but the molecules cn move thru it atleast dats what i think,19.01.2012,12.57.23
446CS7,obivously buyt how,19.01.2012,12.57.24
TUTOR,"Please continue, 452CS7.",19.01.2012,12.57.26
446CS7,okay so like the molucle some thingss pass thru while others dnt,19.01.2012,12.57.52
TUTOR,"Okay, everyone - let's move on to the last experiment.",19.01.2012,12.57.55
452CS7,idk how to continue its just an observation i made,19.01.2012,12.57.55
448CS7,the molucules and the glucose work together i thinkk,19.01.2012,12.57.59
TUTOR,"In this setup we have glucose solution on the outside, pure water on the inside.",19.01.2012,12.58.16
448CS7,on the outside of what though,19.01.2012,12.58.30
TUTOR,"What changes do you think you'll see in this condition? Agree on a prediction for what you'll observe over time, *and* an explanation that everyone understands.",19.01.2012,12.58.40
446CS7,i think tht there will b no water left in the package,19.01.2012,12.58.55
448CS7,i agreee with you 446CS7 but why?,19.01.2012,12.59.14
446CS7,bcuz the water wuld b suckd up by the glucose,19.01.2012,12.59.24
452CS7,i think the glucose molecules will seep thru the tube like in the other thing we just did,19.01.2012,12.59.44
TUTOR,"Please explain your prediction, 452CS7.",19.01.2012,12.59.47
448CS7,what did you write on the paper?,19.01.2012,12.59.50
446CS7,wen the water passes thru the casin it will mix n form together,19.01.2012,12.59.50
446CS7,i didnt rite nothing,19.01.2012,13.00.15
448CS7,me neither we have to figure out what to write for the chart part at the top,19.01.2012,13.00.40
452CS7,like they can enter since in the other experiment they exited the tube,19.01.2012,13.00.41
TUTOR,"Keep on explaining, 452CS7.",19.01.2012,13.00.44
446CS7,landons to smarrt,19.01.2012,13.00.56
452CS7,:)),19.01.2012,13.00.59
448CS7,i agree,19.01.2012,13.01.27
TUTOR,"Make sure each of you is clear on your team's prediction and explanation, and write it in your worksheet.",19.01.2012,13.02.18
448CS7,we have to come up with a prediction for the bottom and why we think that,19.01.2012,13.02.21
448CS7,any thoughts?,19.01.2012,13.02.30
452CS7,what do we have to predict?,19.01.2012,13.02.39
448CS7,not sure haha,19.01.2012,13.02.47
446CS7,is this the only picture for this one,19.01.2012,13.02.50
TUTOR,"All right, we're wrapping up. Thanks, team!",19.01.2012,13.03.02
448CS7,its the last one so i think so,19.01.2012,13.03.12
446CS7,mkay,19.01.2012,13.03.19
452CS7,that the bag will get lighter,19.01.2012,13.03.42
452CS7,becuz in the last expirement it got heavier,19.01.2012,13.03.54
448CS7,look at the bottom part with the lines in the chart we have to answer those and write why at the bottom,19.01.2012,13.04.04
446CS7,and the strip color will turn green,19.01.2012,13.04.07
448CS7,why 446CS7,19.01.2012,13.04.17
448CS7,will it turn green on the inside or outside,19.01.2012,13.04.37
446CS7,bc when u take tht test it changes from yello to green so wen they mix or disolve it will also turn green..... i think both,19.01.2012,13.05.10
452CS7,ok so what are we writing down we all need the same thing,19.01.2012,13.05.15
446CS7,bcuz thery r both exposed to it,19.01.2012,13.05.20
452CS7,^ agree,19.01.2012,13.05.31
446CS7,am i maken sence or do i sound dum,19.01.2012,13.05.42
452CS7,naw u make since,19.01.2012,13.05.50
452CS7,so wat we writing?,19.01.2012,13.05.55
448CS7,so the strip color inside will be yellow then the strip color outside will be green?,19.01.2012,13.05.56
448CS7,then what about the weight heavier or lighter?,19.01.2012,13.06.14
446CS7,no bothe green they r both exposed to it,19.01.2012,13.06.18
452CS7,,19.01.2012,13.06.20
446CS7,,19.01.2012,13.06.25
452CS7,bye bye,19.01.2012,13.06.37
448CS7,heavier or lighter for weight?,19.01.2012,13.06.44
452CS7,leaves the room,19.01.2012,13.18.40
446CS7,leaves the room,19.01.2012,13.19.22
448CS7,leaves the room,19.01.2012,13.21.07
TUTOR,leaves the room,19.01.2012,13.22.51
