TUTOR,"Hi, my name is Sage. I'll be working with you in this activity. Take a minute to introduce yourselves.",19.01.2012,02.18.42
TUTOR,leaves the room,19.01.2012,02.18.46
467CS9,hey katey baby ;0,19.01.2012,02.19.02

TUTOR,"I won't tell you if you're right or wrong, but I'll give feedback as you discuss things as a team.",19.01.2012,02.19.59
467CS9,katety smels p,19.01.2012,02.20.01
467CS9,pp,19.01.2012,02.20.14
TUTOR,Let's look at a setup which is the opposite of the one we saw earlier - the iodine is now inside and the starch is outside.,19.01.2012,02.20.15
TUTOR,"<< On the whiteboard, you can see a picture of this new setup.",19.01.2012,02.20.41
478CS9,Me and isha are partying on friday :D,19.01.2012,02.20.44
467CS9,the starch wil stil turn purple,19.01.2012,02.20.50
TUTOR,<< Here's what happened in this setup over time.,19.01.2012,02.20.54
TUTOR,Notice how the inside and outside environments changed. Why did these changes happen?,19.01.2012,02.21.16
467CS9,im right :),19.01.2012,02.21.29
TUTOR,*smiles*,19.01.2012,02.21.33
478CS9,Alicia's so smartt,19.01.2012,02.22.40
467CS9,thanks taty bby<3,19.01.2012,02.22.57
478CS9,Sage. Teach us more,19.01.2012,02.23.20
TUTOR,"Okay, 478CS9 - why would the size of the molecules be relevant?",19.01.2012,02.23.24
478CS9,it shows if it leaked out?,19.01.2012,02.24.16
478CS9,i think,19.01.2012,02.24.19
TUTOR,"Okay, team - in a moment we'll move to another set of experiments.",19.01.2012,02.24.49
TUTOR,"For these experiments, we'll use the same membrane, but with pure water on the outside and a glucose solution on the inside.",19.01.2012,02.25.13
TUTOR,Discuss the differences between glucose and starch molecules.,19.01.2012,02.25.43
TUTOR,We'll use the tube weight as an indicator for water movement.,19.01.2012,02.26.36
TUTOR,We'll also use *glucose test strips* to detect glucose in both environments.,19.01.2012,02.26.40
TUTOR,"<< On the whiteboard, you can see what happened in this setup over time.",19.01.2012,02.26.54
467CS9,the glucose turns the strip green but the startch turns iodine purple,19.01.2012,02.27.13
TUTOR,"The results with glucose are different than what you saw with starch - as a team, discuss and agree upon an explanation for these results.",19.01.2012,02.27.18
467CS9,the cel membrane was not strong enouth to kep the water from geting in to the bag. we know that because the bag weighs more.,19.01.2012,02.28.43
TUTOR,It's nice that you're explaining your reasoning.,19.01.2012,02.28.48
478CS9,Im confused.,19.01.2012,02.29.06
467CS9,the bag weights more because the water went in to the bag,19.01.2012,02.29.42
TUTOR,It's nice that you're explaining your reasoning.,19.01.2012,02.29.47
TUTOR,"Okay, everyone - let's move on to the last experiment.",19.01.2012,02.30.55
478CS9,The bag with the starch in it?,19.01.2012,02.31.04
467CS9,no its not starch anymore,19.01.2012,02.31.16
TUTOR,"In this setup we have glucose solution on the outside, pure water on the inside.",19.01.2012,02.31.16
478CS9,Oh okay,19.01.2012,02.31.24
478CS9,We moved on.,19.01.2012,02.31.31
TUTOR,"What changes do you think you'll see in this condition? Agree on a prediction for what you'll observe over time, *and* an explanation that everyone understands.",19.01.2012,02.31.40
478CS9,I dont think anythings gonna happen,19.01.2012,02.32.36
478CS9,Im still confused on the whole situation...,19.01.2012,02.32.47
467CS9,i think the bag wil leak out n the inside and out side wil be positive for glucose,19.01.2012,02.32.57
TUTOR,"Please continue, 467CS9.",19.01.2012,02.33.01
467CS9,the water is going to leak out of the bag after 24 hour,19.01.2012,02.33.29
478CS9,So it's gonna break?,19.01.2012,02.33.42
467CS9,not realy its just that the cel membraine isnt strong enough to contain it,19.01.2012,02.34.24
478CS9,Ohh oky doky,19.01.2012,02.34.35
TUTOR,"Make sure each of you is clear on your team's prediction and explanation, and write it in your worksheet.",19.01.2012,02.35.18
467CS9,u got it katey?,19.01.2012,02.35.50
478CS9,So wait what are we for sure writing. That the baggies gonna leak,19.01.2012,02.35.55
478CS9,?,19.01.2012,02.35.57
478CS9,right,19.01.2012,02.35.59
TUTOR,"All right, we're wrapping up. Thanks, team!",19.01.2012,02.36.02
467CS9,yeah n that the strips wil both turn gren,19.01.2012,02.36.39
478CS9,Lets move on sage,19.01.2012,02.36.46
478CS9,Okay now what are we writing,19.01.2012,02.39.00
467CS9,leaves the room,19.01.2012,02.39.33
