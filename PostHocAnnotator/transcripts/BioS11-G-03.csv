570CN7,565CN7,23.01.2012,12.46.17
TUTOR,Let's look at a setup which is the opposite of the one we saw earlier - the iodine is now inside and the starch is outside.,23.01.2012,12.46.30

570CN7,"nothing, hbu.?",23.01.2012,12.47.07
TUTOR,<< Here's what happened in this setup over time.,23.01.2012,12.47.10
557CN7,CHILLIN,23.01.2012,12.47.20
TUTOR,Notice how the inside and outside environments changed. Why did these changes happen?,23.01.2012,12.47.32
557CN7,THE IDONE WENT OUT OF THE BAG INTO THE SOLUTION,23.01.2012,12.47.53
565CN7,It has starch in it.,23.01.2012,12.47.54
570CN7,ohh thats cool.,23.01.2012,12.47.56
557CN7,YEA LOL,23.01.2012,12.48.12
565CN7,the bag got starch in it,23.01.2012,12.48.14
557CN7,nu uh the starch is in the beaker,23.01.2012,12.48.31
557CN7,the bag has idone in it,23.01.2012,12.48.43
557CN7,iodine,23.01.2012,12.48.53
565CN7,OOOOHHHH The starch will change colors out of the bag,23.01.2012,12.49.02
570CN7,the water is deluting the iodine.,23.01.2012,12.49.11
557CN7,yea cuz the iodine came out which turned the water / starch blak,23.01.2012,12.49.30
565CN7,Gotchuu bbg,23.01.2012,12.49.40
557CN7,; ],23.01.2012,12.49.49
570CN7,ohkaay good da;shaia.,23.01.2012,12.49.58
557CN7,oh yea im smart,23.01.2012,12.50.07
565CN7,what now sage ?,23.01.2012,12.50.10
557CN7,idk i think we figured it out we jus gotta come up eith an expalation,23.01.2012,12.50.40
570CN7,you think your smart but your really not.(:,23.01.2012,12.50.43
557CN7,lol thats mean,23.01.2012,12.50.52
570CN7,nahuh.,23.01.2012,12.51.01
TUTOR,"Okay, team - in a moment we'll move to another set of experiments.",23.01.2012,12.51.05
557CN7,yu uh,23.01.2012,12.51.08
TUTOR,"For these experiments, we'll use the same membrane, but with pure water on the outside and a glucose solution on the inside.",23.01.2012,12.51.28
570CN7,ohkaaay sage.,23.01.2012,12.51.48
TUTOR,Discuss the differences between glucose and starch molecules.,23.01.2012,12.51.59
557CN7,the glucose came out the bag in went into the water,23.01.2012,12.52.27
565CN7,Glucose stays in the bag and doesnt move through out the water .,23.01.2012,12.52.36
TUTOR,We'll use the tube weight as an indicator for water movement.,23.01.2012,12.52.51
557CN7,yes it does because the strip turned green,23.01.2012,12.52.55
TUTOR,We'll also use *glucose test strips* to detect glucose in both environments.,23.01.2012,12.52.55
570CN7,the glucose came out of the bag &&' when into the water.,23.01.2012,12.53.06
TUTOR,"<< On the whiteboard, you can see what happened in this setup over time.",23.01.2012,12.53.09
TUTOR,"The results with glucose are different than what you saw with starch - as a team, discuss and agree upon an explanation for these results.",23.01.2012,12.53.33
557CN7,yes the glucose came out of the bag over time and turned the strip green,23.01.2012,12.53.42
570CN7,as time goes on the water gets more glucose in it &&' tures the strip darker green.,23.01.2012,12.54.01
565CN7,agreed .,23.01.2012,12.54.17

557CN7,the glucose went into the bag,23.01.2012,12.58.15
570CN7,agreed.,23.01.2012,12.58.24
