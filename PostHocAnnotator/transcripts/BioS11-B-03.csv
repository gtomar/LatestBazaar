TUTOR,"Hi, my name is Sage. I'll be working with you in this activity. Take a minute to introduce yourselves.",19.01.2012,12.42.55
457CS7,HI,19.01.2012,12.43.36
TUTOR,"I won't tell you if you're right or wrong, but I'll give feedback as you discuss things as a team.",19.01.2012,12.43.39
TUTOR,Let's look at a setup which is the opposite of the one we saw earlier - the iodine is now inside and the starch is outside.,19.01.2012,12.43.55
458CS7,HELLO,19.01.2012,12.44.01
457CS7,anybody?????????????,19.01.2012,12.44.07
457CS7,,19.01.2012,12.44.07
457CS7,,19.01.2012,12.44.08
450CS7,hi,19.01.2012,12.44.14
TUTOR,"<< On the whiteboard, you can see a picture of this new setup.",19.01.2012,12.44.22
TUTOR,<< Here's what happened in this setup over time.,19.01.2012,12.44.35
457CS7,563CN7(jj) moneybags in the hizouse,19.01.2012,12.44.43
450CS7,mark look at me,19.01.2012,12.44.53
TUTOR,Notice how the inside and outside environments changed. Why did these changes happen?,19.01.2012,12.44.57
457CS7,hahahahaha jordanBACKSLASH,19.01.2012,12.45.56
TUTOR,:-),19.01.2012,12.46.00
457CS7,,19.01.2012,12.46.15
450CS7,,19.01.2012,12.46.21
457CS7,"jordan, taylor, Whats going on????",19.01.2012,12.47.12
TUTOR,"Thanks for that, 457CS7. Can anyone respond?",19.01.2012,12.47.17
TUTOR,"Okay, team - in a moment we'll move to another set of experiments.",19.01.2012,12.48.30
458CS7,these changes happened because the iodine was in starch,19.01.2012,12.48.40
TUTOR,"For these experiments, we'll use the same membrane, but with pure water on the outside and a glucose solution on the inside.",19.01.2012,12.48.54
457CS7,ooh and it lost weight,19.01.2012,12.48.58
TUTOR,Discuss the differences between glucose and starch molecules.,19.01.2012,12.49.24
450CS7,this taking to long,19.01.2012,12.49.29
TUTOR,We'll use the tube weight as an indicator for water movement.,19.01.2012,12.50.17
TUTOR,We'll also use *glucose test strips* to detect glucose in both environments.,19.01.2012,12.50.20
457CS7,haha nice but i think that it has different densitys,19.01.2012,12.50.27
TUTOR,"<< On the whiteboard, you can see what happened in this setup over time.",19.01.2012,12.50.35
TUTOR,"The results with glucose are different than what you saw with starch - as a team, discuss and agree upon an explanation for these results.",19.01.2012,12.50.59
457CS7,i think the faster we talk the faster it goes,19.01.2012,12.51.03

TUTOR,457CS7 ...what else can you say about how we use indicators?,19.01.2012,12.52.41
457CS7,outside starch,19.01.2012,12.52.42
458CS7,yes,19.01.2012,12.53.44

457CS7,now what,19.01.2012,12.54.26
TUTOR,"Okay, everyone - let's move on to the last experiment.",19.01.2012,12.54.36
TUTOR,"In this setup we have glucose solution on the outside, pure water on the inside.",19.01.2012,12.54.57
450CS7,my page is still blank,19.01.2012,12.55.13
TUTOR,"What changes do you think you'll see in this condition? Agree on a prediction for what you'll observe over time, *and* an explanation that everyone understands.",19.01.2012,12.55.21
450CS7,im confused,19.01.2012,12.55.34
