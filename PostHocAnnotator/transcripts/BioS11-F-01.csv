TUTOR,"Hi, my name is Sage. I'll be working with you in this activity. Take a minute to introduce yourselves.",23.01.2012,11.13.57
TUTOR,"I won't tell you if you're right or wrong, but I'll give feedback as you discuss things as a team.",23.01.2012,11.14.42
504CN1,hi dajha!,23.01.2012,11.14.49
550CN5,leaves the room,23.01.2012,11.14.54
TUTOR,Let's look at a setup which is the opposite of the one we saw earlier - the iodine is now inside and the starch is outside.,23.01.2012,11.14.58
550CN5,joins the room,23.01.2012,11.15.18
TUTOR,"<< On the whiteboard, you can see a picture of this new setup.",23.01.2012,11.15.24
550CN5,Vinny<3,23.01.2012,11.15.29
TUTOR,<< Here's what happened in this setup over time.,23.01.2012,11.15.38
TUTOR,Notice how the inside and outside environments changed. Why did these changes happen?,23.01.2012,11.15.59
504CN1,the iodine left the bag,23.01.2012,11.16.26
TUTOR,"Okay, 504CN1 - why would how we use indicators be relevant?",23.01.2012,11.16.31
550CN5,the iodine was never in the bag the iodine went into the,23.01.2012,11.17.39
550CN5,bag,23.01.2012,11.17.48
504CN1,the weight is decreasing and and the starch water changed colors,23.01.2012,11.17.51
TUTOR,Any input from 539CN5?,23.01.2012,11.17.54
539CN5,if you loook at the diogeam it shows the big getting liter because the iodine left the bag,23.01.2012,11.18.59
550CN5,agreed...,23.01.2012,11.19.21
504CN1,agreed...,23.01.2012,11.19.26
TUTOR,"Okay, team - in a moment we'll move to another set of experiments.",23.01.2012,11.19.32
TUTOR,"For these experiments, we'll use the same membrane, but with pure water on the outside and a glucose solution on the inside.",23.01.2012,11.19.56
TUTOR,Discuss the differences between glucose and starch molecules.,23.01.2012,11.20.27
550CN5,glucose molecules weigh less,23.01.2012,11.20.46
TUTOR,We'll use the tube weight as an indicator for water movement.,23.01.2012,11.21.19
TUTOR,We'll also use *glucose test strips* to detect glucose in both environments.,23.01.2012,11.21.23
TUTOR,"<< On the whiteboard, you can see what happened in this setup over time.",23.01.2012,11.21.37
TUTOR,"The results with glucose are different than what you saw with starch - as a team, discuss and agree upon an explanation for these results.",23.01.2012,11.22.01
504CN1,the weight of the gluclose soltuion increased over the time period..,23.01.2012,11.22.50
539CN5,the water has no suger in it so the strip will stay yellow. the gucose solution has duger so the strip will turn green,23.01.2012,11.22.59
550CN5,i think the glucpse molecules left the bag and went into the water in the process of that water molecules entered the bag,23.01.2012,11.23.03
504CN1,once again......agreed with dajha ... hahaBACKSLASH,23.01.2012,11.23.41
550CN5,always a smart thing to do :),23.01.2012,11.24.00
504CN1,but also i agree with vicky too ;),23.01.2012,11.24.41
504CN1,:),23.01.2012,11.24.50
539CN5,and over time glucose cane out of the bag and got into the water and that is why after 1 hour and 24 hours the strip that was in the water started to change.,23.01.2012,11.25.32
TUTOR,"Okay, everyone - let's move on to the last experiment.",23.01.2012,11.25.38
TUTOR,"In this setup we have glucose solution on the outside, pure water on the inside.",23.01.2012,11.26.00
TUTOR,"What changes do you think you'll see in this condition? Agree on a prediction for what you'll observe over time, *and* an explanation that everyone understands.",23.01.2012,11.26.23
539CN5,the water has not suger so the strip is yellow,23.01.2012,11.26.50
539CN5,and the glucose has suger and the strip is green,23.01.2012,11.27.36
TUTOR,"So is 539CN5 saying ""a glucose test strip changes color when glucose is there?""",23.01.2012,11.27.41
539CN5,yes,23.01.2012,11.27.51
504CN1,i think the gluclose test strip will slowly change to a bright yellow color it is on the weighing scale. also i think the bag of distilled water will weigh more because over time of sitting in the gloclose you will get some glucose molecules in the,23.01.2012,11.28.06
550CN5,i don't think the sugar molecules will get in side the membrane i think they will be to big i think the water molecules will come out of the membrane and go into a concentrated equal enviorment,23.01.2012,11.28.06
TUTOR,"Would another way to say that be ""molecules will move to the area of lower concentration if they can?""",23.01.2012,11.28.13
550CN5,yes,23.01.2012,11.28.38
504CN1,agreed........with dajha AGAIN!.,23.01.2012,11.29.41
539CN5,i agree to,23.01.2012,11.29.51
TUTOR,"Make sure each of you is clear on your team's prediction and explanation, and write it in your worksheet.",23.01.2012,11.30.02
504CN1,WE ALL AGREE!:),23.01.2012,11.30.09
TUTOR,"All right, we're wrapping up. Thanks, team!",23.01.2012,11.30.45
550CN5,just to restate... the sugar molecules will not go into the membrane the distellied water will come out and the test strip will turn yellow,23.01.2012,11.30.53
550CN5,leaves the room,23.01.2012,11.33.34
539CN5,leaves the room,23.01.2012,11.34.28
