TUTOR,"Hi, my name is Sage. I'll be working with you in this activity. Take a minute to introduce yourselves.",19.01.2012,08.09.24
TUTOR,"I won't tell you if you're right or wrong, but I'll give feedback as you discuss things as a team.",19.01.2012,08.10.08
403CS1,leaves the room,19.01.2012,08.10.22
TUTOR,Let's look at a setup which is the opposite of the one we saw earlier - the iodine is now inside and the starch is outside.,19.01.2012,08.10.24
TUTOR,"<< On the whiteboard, you can see a picture of this new setup.",19.01.2012,08.10.51
TUTOR,<< Here's what happened in this setup over time.,19.01.2012,08.11.04
403CS1,joins the room,19.01.2012,08.11.11
TUTOR,Notice how the inside and outside environments changed. Why did these changes happen?,19.01.2012,08.11.26
403CS1,what r we doing,19.01.2012,08.11.59
433CS1,water,19.01.2012,08.12.34
403CS1,?,19.01.2012,08.12.43
433CS1,water,19.01.2012,08.12.49
403CS1,ur stupid,19.01.2012,08.12.56
433CS1,more water,19.01.2012,08.12.58
403CS1,:),19.01.2012,08.13.03
422CS1,we are discussing the observations i think.,19.01.2012,08.13.05
403CS1,how,19.01.2012,08.13.17
433CS1,whats up,19.01.2012,08.14.05
403CS1,it changed becouse the tube obsorbed the iodine,19.01.2012,08.14.51
TUTOR,"So is 403CS1 saying ""the molecules diffused through the membrane?""",19.01.2012,08.14.55
403CS1,the outside collor,19.01.2012,08.15.02
TUTOR,"Okay, team - in a moment we'll move to another set of experiments.",19.01.2012,08.15.04
TUTOR,"For these experiments, we'll use the same membrane, but with pure water on the outside and a glucose solution on the inside.",19.01.2012,08.15.22
433CS1,okie dokie,19.01.2012,08.15.25
TUTOR,Discuss the differences between glucose and starch molecules.,19.01.2012,08.15.53
TUTOR,We'll use the tube weight as an indicator for water movement.,19.01.2012,08.16.45
TUTOR,We'll also use *glucose test strips* to detect glucose in both environments.,19.01.2012,08.16.49
TUTOR,"<< On the whiteboard, you can see what happened in this setup over time.",19.01.2012,08.17.03
403CS1,its saing that startch has surger molacules in it and iodian dosent,19.01.2012,08.17.16
TUTOR,"The results with glucose are different than what you saw with starch - as a team, discuss and agree upon an explanation for these results.",19.01.2012,08.17.27
403CS1,when the iodine is mixed with startch the is alot of surger in it,19.01.2012,08.18.28
TUTOR,Talk a little more about how we use indicators...,19.01.2012,08.18.32
403CS1,well if my team helped me,19.01.2012,08.18.56
433CS1,as the glucose sat in the water it absorbed the glucose and weighed more,19.01.2012,08.18.58
TUTOR,I'd love to hear more from 422CS1...,19.01.2012,08.19.02
422CS1,im looking at the first one. mine never changed.,19.01.2012,08.20.05
433CS1,"after many hours, the weight increased",19.01.2012,08.20.38
422CS1,,19.01.2012,08.20.39
TUTOR,"Would that be the same as saying ""the weight was observed to increase?""",19.01.2012,08.20.43
TUTOR,"Okay, everyone - let's move on to the last experiment.",19.01.2012,08.21.04
403CS1,iodian has no surger in it but startch does and when it absorbes the iodian ther is more glucose in,19.01.2012,08.21.10
TUTOR,"In this setup we have glucose solution on the outside, pure water on the inside.",19.01.2012,08.21.26
433CS1,the glucose increased,19.01.2012,08.21.39
TUTOR,"What changes do you think you'll see in this condition? Agree on a prediction for what you'll observe over time, *and* an explanation that everyone understands.",19.01.2012,08.21.50
433CS1,"the glucose will increase, and definetly weigh more",19.01.2012,08.22.44
TUTOR,"Would another way to say that be ""things go from higher concentration to lower concentration when they can?""",19.01.2012,08.22.49
403CS1,when the iodian mixed with the watwer the glucose left the tube do u understand what im trying to say,19.01.2012,08.23.08
433CS1,it turns yellow when theres glucose in it,19.01.2012,08.23.57
TUTOR,"Would that be the same as saying ""a glucose test strip changes color when glucose is there?""",19.01.2012,08.24.01
403CS1,no green meanes thers glucose,19.01.2012,08.24.24
403CS1,yellow means no,19.01.2012,08.24.35
433CS1,I think so,19.01.2012,08.25.07
422CS1,i agree with Jordan.,19.01.2012,08.25.22
TUTOR,"Make sure each of you is clear on your team's prediction and explanation, and write it in your worksheet.",19.01.2012,08.25.28
403CS1,whats the perdiction,19.01.2012,08.25.42
433CS1,whatever you say,19.01.2012,08.25.57
TUTOR,"All right, we're wrapping up. Thanks, team!",19.01.2012,08.26.11
403CS1,ok,19.01.2012,08.26.26
422CS1,okay,19.01.2012,08.26.46
422CS1,so what was the prediction?,19.01.2012,08.27.47
403CS1,when the tube obsorbed the iodian it released the glucose,19.01.2012,08.28.18
403CS1,theis ok,19.01.2012,08.28.27
433CS1,ya,19.01.2012,08.28.39
