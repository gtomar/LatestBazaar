424CS1,joins the room,19.01.2012,08.08.55
430CS1,now what,19.01.2012,08.09.02
430CS1,wat do we doooooooooooooooo,19.01.2012,08.09.15
415CS1,joins the room,19.01.2012,08.09.17
TUTOR,joins the room,19.01.2012,08.09.22
430CS1,is anyone reading,19.01.2012,08.09.26
TUTOR,"Hi, my name is Sage. I'll be working with you in this activity. Take a minute to introduce yourselves.",19.01.2012,08.09.29
424CS1,no,19.01.2012,08.09.30
430CS1,Hi I am Samone,19.01.2012,08.10.01
424CS1,"no ,",19.01.2012,08.10.05
TUTOR,"I won't tell you if you're right or wrong, but I'll give feedback as you discuss things as a team.",19.01.2012,08.10.14
424CS1,"okaaaaaay ,",19.01.2012,08.10.23
TUTOR,Let's look at a setup which is the opposite of the one we saw earlier - the iodine is now inside and the starch is outside.,19.01.2012,08.10.30
TUTOR,"<< On the whiteboard, you can see a picture of this new setup.",19.01.2012,08.10.56
TUTOR,<< Here's what happened in this setup over time.,19.01.2012,08.11.09
TUTOR,Notice how the inside and outside environments changed. Why did these changes happen?,19.01.2012,08.11.31
415CS1,iodine seeped through,19.01.2012,08.12.16
TUTOR,"415CS1, is this similar to ""molecules are always moving randomly?""",19.01.2012,08.12.21
TUTOR,415CS1 might have something to add to the discussion...,19.01.2012,08.12.32
430CS1,add more Taylor,19.01.2012,08.12.53
424CS1,"yeah ,",19.01.2012,08.12.58
415CS1,i guess,19.01.2012,08.13.12
430CS1,wat else,19.01.2012,08.13.24
424CS1,the 'molicules' probally went thruogh the plastic or absorbed in the plastic,19.01.2012,08.14.05
TUTOR,"Okay, team - in a moment we'll move to another set of experiments.",19.01.2012,08.15.04
TUTOR,"For these experiments, we'll use the same membrane, but with pure water on the outside and a glucose solution on the inside.",19.01.2012,08.15.28
TUTOR,Discuss the differences between glucose and starch molecules.,19.01.2012,08.15.58
424CS1,"wait , whaaaaaaaat !?",19.01.2012,08.16.41
TUTOR,We'll use the tube weight as an indicator for water movement.,19.01.2012,08.16.51
415CS1,i'm confused,19.01.2012,08.16.52
TUTOR,We'll also use *glucose test strips* to detect glucose in both environments.,19.01.2012,08.16.55
TUTOR,"<< On the whiteboard, you can see what happened in this setup over time.",19.01.2012,08.17.09
TUTOR,"The results with glucose are different than what you saw with starch - as a team, discuss and agree upon an explanation for these results.",19.01.2012,08.17.33
430CS1,the glucose went into the water instead of staying inside of the bag,19.01.2012,08.18.09
424CS1,im still confused !,19.01.2012,08.18.31
415CS1,"as time progressed, the water's glucose amount increased. maybe because of the reaction",19.01.2012,08.18.32
430CS1,idk? how the glucose bag wieghts more,19.01.2012,08.18.48
TUTOR,"Okay, 430CS1 - why would the size of the molecules be relevant?",19.01.2012,08.18.53
424CS1,cus theres a solid in in ?BACKSLASH,19.01.2012,08.19.42
430CS1,no,19.01.2012,08.19.55
424CS1,who me ?,19.01.2012,08.20.09
430CS1,"the glucose probably wieghts more than the iodine, dud e said gluclose is a bigger molecule",19.01.2012,08.20.51
TUTOR,430CS1 ...what else can you say about how we use indicators?,19.01.2012,08.20.56
TUTOR,"Okay, everyone - let's move on to the last experiment.",19.01.2012,08.21.10
TUTOR,"In this setup we have glucose solution on the outside, pure water on the inside.",19.01.2012,08.21.31
TUTOR,"What changes do you think you'll see in this condition? Agree on a prediction for what you'll observe over time, *and* an explanation that everyone understands.",19.01.2012,08.21.55
430CS1,the gluclpse will somehow go into the distilled water bag,19.01.2012,08.22.56
415CS1,i agree with that,19.01.2012,08.23.07
415CS1,maybe it will weigh more,19.01.2012,08.23.26
424CS1,"i cant see ummmm , 'CONDITION D' ?",19.01.2012,08.23.50
430CS1,click the res square,19.01.2012,08.24.07
430CS1,red,19.01.2012,08.24.12
424CS1,oah nevermind i got it .,19.01.2012,08.24.30
430CS1,the gluclose and the water wil combine making it wieght more,19.01.2012,08.25.03
424CS1,"sooo , what would our explanation be ?",19.01.2012,08.25.05
415CS1,the molecules reacted to each other,19.01.2012,08.25.27
TUTOR,"Make sure each of you is clear on your team's prediction and explanation, and write it in your worksheet.",19.01.2012,08.25.33
430CS1,the gluclose test strip in the bag will turn dark green as time progress,19.01.2012,08.25.47
430CS1,What do u guys think?,19.01.2012,08.26.07
TUTOR,"All right, we're wrapping up. Thanks, team!",19.01.2012,08.26.17
430CS1,lol,19.01.2012,08.26.34
424CS1,dosnent it show us what haoppens to the strip?,19.01.2012,08.26.36
424CS1,happens*,19.01.2012,08.26.43
415CS1,i guess not,19.01.2012,08.26.48
430CS1,thats what we hav to guess,19.01.2012,08.27.16
424CS1,but it its green in the water and then they took it out and it turned yellow ?,19.01.2012,08.27.25
430CS1,no their 2 different strips,19.01.2012,08.27.47
415CS1,so what do we write down?,19.01.2012,08.27.49
430CS1,the strip in the vase will tun yellow and in the bag it will turn green,19.01.2012,08.28.16
430CS1,it will weight more,19.01.2012,08.28.30
424CS1,"oaaaah , i think the strip will stay yellow / green because theres no glucose /",19.01.2012,08.28.33
430CS1,?,19.01.2012,08.28.34
424CS1,?,19.01.2012,08.28.35
430CS1,Talor?,19.01.2012,08.28.59
415CS1,Yes?,19.01.2012,08.29.17
424CS1,the bags not gonna weight more its just water . .,19.01.2012,08.29.33
430CS1,then gluclose will go in it,19.01.2012,08.29.46
424CS1,"oah , lol . idk did anything in the other solutions give us the answer ?",19.01.2012,08.30.14
415CS1,well the strip in the vase turned darker last time so won't it get lighter? and won't the water seep through like always?,19.01.2012,08.30.15
430CS1,yes it will,19.01.2012,08.30.31
430CS1,thats what deffusion is,19.01.2012,08.30.41
424CS1,yeah,19.01.2012,08.30.45
430CS1,tellin you,19.01.2012,08.30.45
430CS1,iside=green,19.01.2012,08.30.55
430CS1,outside=yellow,19.01.2012,08.31.00
424CS1,"okay ,",19.01.2012,08.31.03
430CS1,weight=more,19.01.2012,08.31.04
415CS1,okay,19.01.2012,08.31.27
415CS1,leaves the room,19.01.2012,08.39.41
430CS1,leaves the room,19.01.2012,08.41.33
424CS1,leaves the room,19.01.2012,08.41.56
TUTOR,leaves the room,19.01.2012,08.50.04
