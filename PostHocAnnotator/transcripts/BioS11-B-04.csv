TUTOR,"Hi, my name is Sage. I'll be working with you in this activity. Take a minute to introduce yourselves.",19.01.2012,12.42.53
444CS7,My name is obivously Mark G.,19.01.2012,12.43.23

TUTOR,"I won't tell you if you're right or wrong, but I'll give feedback as you discuss things as a team.",19.01.2012,12.43.38
TUTOR,Let's look at a setup which is the opposite of the one we saw earlier - the iodine is now inside and the starch is outside.,19.01.2012,12.43.54
TUTOR,"<< On the whiteboard, you can see a picture of this new setup.",19.01.2012,12.44.21
TUTOR,<< Here's what happened in this setup over time.,19.01.2012,12.44.33
TUTOR,Notice how the inside and outside environments changed. Why did these changes happen?,19.01.2012,12.44.56
443CS7,Waz good my homies,19.01.2012,12.45.15
TUTOR,:-),19.01.2012,12.45.18

443CS7,Da hell we do,19.01.2012,12.46.32
434CS7,i have no clue,19.01.2012,12.46.41
444CS7,because the iodine was in the pack and the starch was in the water,19.01.2012,12.46.45
443CS7,the changed cuz da iodine and water was all like we should go chill with da starch water,19.01.2012,12.48.12
444CS7,wow Ed,19.01.2012,12.48.26
TUTOR,"Okay, team - in a moment we'll move to another set of experiments.",19.01.2012,12.48.28

TUTOR,"For these experiments, we'll use the same membrane, but with pure water on the outside and a glucose solution on the inside.",19.01.2012,12.48.52
443CS7,ight,19.01.2012,12.49.05
TUTOR,Discuss the differences between glucose and starch molecules.,19.01.2012,12.49.23
444CS7,stuff turns to green in one and purple in another,19.01.2012,12.50.01
TUTOR,We'll use the tube weight as an indicator for water movement.,19.01.2012,12.50.15
TUTOR,We'll also use *glucose test strips* to detect glucose in both environments.,19.01.2012,12.50.19
TUTOR,"<< On the whiteboard, you can see what happened in this setup over time.",19.01.2012,12.50.33
TUTOR,"The results with glucose are different than what you saw with starch - as a team, discuss and agree upon an explanation for these results.",19.01.2012,12.50.57
443CS7,da distilled water wants to chill with the glucose solution,19.01.2012,12.51.34
443CS7,Mark your weird,19.01.2012,12.51.52
443CS7,Kail,19.01.2012,12.52.52

444CS7,no,19.01.2012,12.54.17
TUTOR,"Okay, everyone - let's move on to the last experiment.",19.01.2012,12.54.34
TUTOR,"In this setup we have glucose solution on the outside, pure water on the inside.",19.01.2012,12.54.56
TUTOR,"What changes do you think you'll see in this condition? Agree on a prediction for what you'll observe over time, *and* an explanation that everyone understands.",19.01.2012,12.55.19
443CS7,the distilled water is going to gain mass,19.01.2012,12.56.45
