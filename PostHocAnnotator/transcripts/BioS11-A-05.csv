TUTOR,"Hi, my name is Sage. I'll be working with you in this activity. Take a minute to introduce yourselves.",19.01.2012,08.09.56
418CS1,heyy,19.01.2012,08.10.07
421CS1,Hiiii my name is autumn,19.01.2012,08.10.21
427CS1,BRIGID :D,19.01.2012,08.10.30
TUTOR,"I won't tell you if you're right or wrong, but I'll give feedback as you discuss things as a team.",19.01.2012,08.10.41
421CS1,okay,19.01.2012,08.10.52
TUTOR,Let's look at a setup which is the opposite of the one we saw earlier - the iodine is now inside and the starch is outside.,19.01.2012,08.10.56
TUTOR,"<< On the whiteboard, you can see a picture of this new setup.",19.01.2012,08.11.23
TUTOR,<< Here's what happened in this setup over time.,19.01.2012,08.11.36
TUTOR,Notice how the inside and outside environments changed. Why did these changes happen?,19.01.2012,08.11.58
427CS1,hmmmmm,19.01.2012,08.12.52
421CS1,"I think these changes happened over time due to the wall, or the bag thingy, becoming week. The substance inside slowly leeked out into the enviroment and changed the color..",19.01.2012,08.13.33
427CS1,it looks like the iodine's color is fading and its starting to weigh less,19.01.2012,08.13.38
421CS1,& thats why the tube bag thingy weighs less,19.01.2012,08.14.24
427CS1,agreed,19.01.2012,08.14.44
TUTOR,"Okay, team - in a moment we'll move to another set of experiments.",19.01.2012,08.15.31
418CS1,okay,19.01.2012,08.15.43
TUTOR,"For these experiments, we'll use the same membrane, but with pure water on the outside and a glucose solution on the inside.",19.01.2012,08.15.55
427CS1,okay,19.01.2012,08.16.05
TUTOR,Discuss the differences between glucose and starch molecules.,19.01.2012,08.16.25
TUTOR,We'll use the tube weight as an indicator for water movement.,19.01.2012,08.17.18
TUTOR,We'll also use *glucose test strips* to detect glucose in both environments.,19.01.2012,08.17.21
TUTOR,"<< On the whiteboard, you can see what happened in this setup over time.",19.01.2012,08.17.35
TUTOR,"The results with glucose are different than what you saw with starch - as a team, discuss and agree upon an explanation for these results.",19.01.2012,08.17.59
427CS1,"the Glucose makes the strip turn green, and the strach makes the strip turn yellos",19.01.2012,08.18.10
427CS1,yellow*,19.01.2012,08.18.16
418CS1,and it gets heavier,19.01.2012,08.18.43
427CS1,and the more the glucose gose into the starch the more green it gets,19.01.2012,08.19.00
418CS1,yes,19.01.2012,08.19.07
421CS1,"Distilled water has very little or maybe none glucose, and over time the water enters the membrane (bag thingy) and increases the weight of the bag, the water outside is also increasing in its glucose molecules",19.01.2012,08.19.18
421CS1,oh and i agreee,19.01.2012,08.19.26
418CS1,i agree,19.01.2012,08.19.41
421CS1,(^^^),19.01.2012,08.19.55
427CS1,YEAH,19.01.2012,08.20.08
418CS1,so whats next,19.01.2012,08.20.46
TUTOR,"Okay, everyone - let's move on to the last experiment.",19.01.2012,08.21.37
418CS1,okay,19.01.2012,08.21.43
427CS1,OKAY,19.01.2012,08.21.45
TUTOR,"In this setup we have glucose solution on the outside, pure water on the inside.",19.01.2012,08.21.58
TUTOR,"What changes do you think you'll see in this condition? Agree on a prediction for what you'll observe over time, *and* an explanation that everyone understands.",19.01.2012,08.22.22
421CS1,"I think the weight of the bag will increase due to the water entering the membrane, and i think the glucose will become stronger over time in the bag thingy. The glucose on the outside will stay the same.",19.01.2012,08.23.32
427CS1,i think the Glucose will go into the membrane (bag thingy) and it will cause it to wiegh more and make the strip turn green,19.01.2012,08.23.35
418CS1,i think the weight will increase,19.01.2012,08.23.58
421CS1,i agree,19.01.2012,08.24.43
421CS1,with everyone,19.01.2012,08.24.51
418CS1,lol she said thingy,19.01.2012,08.25.01
427CS1,:p i dont think water enters the baggy,19.01.2012,08.25.17
427CS1,i think it just stays in there,19.01.2012,08.25.26
418CS1,me too,19.01.2012,08.25.34
427CS1,since its only glucose on the outside,19.01.2012,08.25.36
421CS1,oh i mean the glucose solution lol,19.01.2012,08.25.36
418CS1,so wat we agree on,19.01.2012,08.25.56
TUTOR,"Make sure each of you is clear on your team's prediction and explanation, and write it in your worksheet.",19.01.2012,08.26.00
418CS1,the weight will increase and cause the strip to change color,19.01.2012,08.26.33
TUTOR,"All right, we're wrapping up. Thanks, team!",19.01.2012,08.26.43
418CS1,you welcome,19.01.2012,08.26.53
427CS1,ur not welcome,19.01.2012,08.27.01
427CS1,leaves the room,19.01.2012,08.32.37
421CS1,leaves the room,19.01.2012,08.39.37
