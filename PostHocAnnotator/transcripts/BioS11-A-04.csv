TUTOR,"Hi, my name is Sage. I'll be working with you in this activity. Take a minute to introduce yourselves.",19.01.2012,08.09.38

TUTOR,"I won't tell you if you're right or wrong, but I'll give feedback as you discuss things as a team.",19.01.2012,08.10.23
412CS1,hii jacklyn :),19.01.2012,08.10.31
TUTOR,Let's look at a setup which is the opposite of the one we saw earlier - the iodine is now inside and the starch is outside.,19.01.2012,08.10.39
411CS1,joins the room,19.01.2012,08.10.52
431CS1,"hi 412CS1, and ok",19.01.2012,08.10.58
411CS1,lawl,19.01.2012,08.10.58
TUTOR,"<< On the whiteboard, you can see a picture of this new setup.",19.01.2012,08.11.05
TUTOR,<< Here's what happened in this setup over time.,19.01.2012,08.11.18
411CS1,ur my partners eww,19.01.2012,08.11.25
TUTOR,Notice how the inside and outside environments changed. Why did these changes happen?,19.01.2012,08.11.40
411CS1,i dont like my partners d:,19.01.2012,08.12.17
TUTOR,:-),19.01.2012,08.12.21
411CS1,hi partners,19.01.2012,08.12.25
411CS1,KARLY AND JACKLYN,19.01.2012,08.12.30
412CS1,because the dialysis tube collected the water and it expanded,19.01.2012,08.12.41
431CS1,because the iodine water changed the start water to show it has starch in it,19.01.2012,08.12.42
TUTOR,It's nice that you're explaining your reasoning.,19.01.2012,08.12.47
411CS1,and the color that absorbed into the tube thing made it gain a little extra weight,19.01.2012,08.13.26
411CS1,JACKLYN,19.01.2012,08.13.48
412CS1,its indicaticating that there is starch in the water,19.01.2012,08.13.55
TUTOR,"Would another way to say that be ""iodine can be used to detect the presence of starch?""",19.01.2012,08.13.59
431CS1,but after 24 hours the tube weighs less than it did in the beggining jeremy,19.01.2012,08.14.06
412CS1,yeah,19.01.2012,08.14.36
411CS1,thats true so the iodine thats in the tube would be less dense and the starch takes away some weight and water,19.01.2012,08.14.51
TUTOR,So how is this about how we use indicators?,19.01.2012,08.14.55
411CS1,so hows everyones morning going,19.01.2012,08.15.02
TUTOR,"Okay, team - in a moment we'll move to another set of experiments.",19.01.2012,08.15.13
412CS1,okayy,19.01.2012,08.15.20
411CS1,okie dokie artechokie XD,19.01.2012,08.15.29
TUTOR,"For these experiments, we'll use the same membrane, but with pure water on the outside and a glucose solution on the inside.",19.01.2012,08.15.37
431CS1,okk,19.01.2012,08.15.50
411CS1,O K,19.01.2012,08.15.53
TUTOR,Discuss the differences between glucose and starch molecules.,19.01.2012,08.16.07
411CS1,jacklyn reft your so BORING,19.01.2012,08.16.11
411CS1,talk have a conversation,19.01.2012,08.16.18
412CS1,the starch is more complex than the glucose,19.01.2012,08.16.36
TUTOR,"Would that be the same as saying ""starch molecules are more complex than glucose molecules?""",19.01.2012,08.16.41
412CS1,yeah it would,19.01.2012,08.16.49
411CS1,starch molecules are like potatoes like lots of salt as glucose is lots of sugar like in your blood,19.01.2012,08.16.59
TUTOR,We'll use the tube weight as an indicator for water movement.,19.01.2012,08.17.00
TUTOR,We'll also use *glucose test strips* to detect glucose in both environments.,19.01.2012,08.17.04
TUTOR,"<< On the whiteboard, you can see what happened in this setup over time.",19.01.2012,08.17.18
411CS1,HI,19.01.2012,08.17.36
411CS1,HI,19.01.2012,08.17.37
TUTOR,"The results with glucose are different than what you saw with starch - as a team, discuss and agree upon an explanation for these results.",19.01.2012,08.17.42
412CS1,it weighs more because there is more in it,19.01.2012,08.18.19
411CS1,starch is tested with a tube as the glucose is tested with a piece of paper like material,19.01.2012,08.18.23
TUTOR,"Thanks for offering an explanation, 412CS1 :-)",19.01.2012,08.18.23
431CS1,the longer you leave the test strip in the water the darker green the strip gets and the more weight the glucose solution collects,19.01.2012,08.18.24
412CS1,jackie wouldnt it just show that there was more in it,19.01.2012,08.19.00
TUTOR,"Would another way to say that be ""indicators can prove that there was a change in concentration ?""",19.01.2012,08.19.04
411CS1,wat jacklyn said and starch cant get any darker when purple and the water would be clear so no more,19.01.2012,08.19.09
TUTOR,Talk a little more about the size of the molecules...,19.01.2012,08.19.14
TUTOR,I wonder what 431CS1 has to say.,19.01.2012,08.19.37
412CS1,if the molecule is bigger wouldnt it weigh more?,19.01.2012,08.19.58
411CS1,im invisible in this group T^T,19.01.2012,08.20.02
431CS1,the strip gets darker because its showing there is more in the glucose 412CS1 hmmm i agree with what 412CS1 said,19.01.2012,08.20.40
411CS1,the tube filled with iodine weighs more because it has alot of liquid and the paper has little weight,19.01.2012,08.20.43
TUTOR,It's nice that you're explaining your reasoning.,19.01.2012,08.20.44
TUTOR,"Maybe you could state that as ""the membrane keeps the starch concentration from changing much.""",19.01.2012,08.20.50
412CS1,but how would it keep it from changing?,19.01.2012,08.21.19
TUTOR,"Okay, everyone - let's move on to the last experiment.",19.01.2012,08.21.19
412CS1,okayy,19.01.2012,08.21.34
TUTOR,"In this setup we have glucose solution on the outside, pure water on the inside.",19.01.2012,08.21.41
411CS1,kkkkkkk,19.01.2012,08.21.41
431CS1,it wouldsstop changing due to the amount of glucose,19.01.2012,08.21.42
411CS1,probably,19.01.2012,08.21.49
TUTOR,"What changes do you think you'll see in this condition? Agree on a prediction for what you'll observe over time, *and* an explanation that everyone understands.",19.01.2012,08.22.04
411CS1,the glucose will slowly change over time into light green,19.01.2012,08.22.33
412CS1,i think that there will not have as much glucose in it,19.01.2012,08.22.51
TUTOR,"Thanks for starting a prediction, 412CS1.",19.01.2012,08.22.54
412CS1,your welcome,19.01.2012,08.23.05
411CS1,i dont like this chat im being cheated,19.01.2012,08.23.17
431CS1,but if the test strip is testing for glucose wouldnt the test strip stay dark green because there is more glucose than distilled water jeremy,19.01.2012,08.23.19
TUTOR,"So is 431CS1 saying ""a glucose test strip changes color when glucose is there?""",19.01.2012,08.23.23
411CS1,hey SAGE,19.01.2012,08.23.33
411CS1,yes i guess jacklyn,19.01.2012,08.23.47
431CS1,there is more glucose so the test strip would stay dark green not ghange to light green,19.01.2012,08.24.05
412CS1,"i agree jackie, is the distilled water in the dialysis tubing",19.01.2012,08.24.37
411CS1,true but the tube is filled with water which doesnt do much but glucose does change the strip,19.01.2012,08.24.41
TUTOR,"412CS1, is this similar to ""the membrane is permeable to iodine and water?""",19.01.2012,08.24.42
431CS1,yes the distilled water is in the dialysis tube,19.01.2012,08.25.04
412CS1,i think so,19.01.2012,08.25.07
TUTOR,"So is 431CS1 saying ""the membrane is permeable to water?""",19.01.2012,08.25.08
TUTOR,Ok,19.01.2012,08.25.13
411CS1,so it seems we have an agreement lets put our ideas together,19.01.2012,08.25.20
TUTOR,"Make sure each of you is clear on your team's prediction and explanation, and write it in your worksheet.",19.01.2012,08.25.43
412CS1,so the strip would get darker over time because its showing that there is a large amount of glucose in it,19.01.2012,08.25.53
431CS1,i agree,19.01.2012,08.26.04
411CS1,agreed,19.01.2012,08.26.07
431CS1,:),19.01.2012,08.26.15
411CS1,so we write wat karl said,19.01.2012,08.26.23
TUTOR,"All right, we're wrapping up. Thanks, team!",19.01.2012,08.26.26
431CS1,Welcome :),19.01.2012,08.26.35
412CS1,no problem,19.01.2012,08.26.35

411CS1,sage you so mean i dont like this i started things and u say it was others,19.01.2012,08.27.23
411CS1,KARL,19.01.2012,08.28.01
431CS1,what would you guess the weight would be after 24 hours?,19.01.2012,08.28.15
411CS1,like 0.63,19.01.2012,08.28.26
411CS1,g,19.01.2012,08.28.29
431CS1,alrighty,19.01.2012,08.28.36
411CS1,wats strip color inside,19.01.2012,08.29.07
