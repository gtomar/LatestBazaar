455CS7,joins the room,19.01.2012,12.42.29
451CS7,joins the room,19.01.2012,12.42.45
TUTOR,"Hi, my name is Sage. I'll be working with you in this activity. Take a minute to introduce yourselves.",19.01.2012,12.42.50
461CS7,i am Summer,19.01.2012,12.43.24
TUTOR,"I won't tell you if you're right or wrong, but I'll give feedback as you discuss things as a team.",19.01.2012,12.43.35
TUTOR,Let's look at a setup which is the opposite of the one we saw earlier - the iodine is now inside and the starch is outside.,19.01.2012,12.43.50
451CS7,leaves the room,19.01.2012,12.43.57
TUTOR,"<< On the whiteboard, you can see a picture of this new setup.",19.01.2012,12.44.17
TUTOR,<< Here's what happened in this setup over time.,19.01.2012,12.44.30
451CS7,joins the room,19.01.2012,12.44.42
TUTOR,Notice how the inside and outside environments changed. Why did these changes happen?,19.01.2012,12.44.52
451CS7,HEYY GUYS,19.01.2012,12.45.02
461CS7,hi it happened because starch and water was mixed with iodine and water,19.01.2012,12.45.46
451CS7,woah i had to logout my computer wat r we talking about,19.01.2012,12.46.19
461CS7,can u c the old chat or naw,19.01.2012,12.46.33
451CS7,yeah,19.01.2012,12.46.41
461CS7,ok read it,19.01.2012,12.46.47
455CS7,Duh lol,19.01.2012,12.46.48
461CS7,did u read it,19.01.2012,12.47.03
455CS7,Read what?,19.01.2012,12.47.08
461CS7,do u now what we r doing,19.01.2012,12.47.21
TUTOR,"so, is Summer saying that iodine diffused out?",19.01.2012,12.47.42
455CS7,Are you Summer?,19.01.2012,12.48.10
461CS7,i am,19.01.2012,12.48.21
451CS7,i read it,19.01.2012,12.48.22
TUTOR,"Okay, team - in a moment we'll move to another set of experiments.",19.01.2012,12.48.25
461CS7,ok did u c what u siad,19.01.2012,12.48.33
455CS7,I mean is that what you were saying?,19.01.2012,12.48.38
461CS7,ya,19.01.2012,12.48.45
TUTOR,"For these experiments, we'll use the same membrane, but with pure water on the outside and a glucose solution on the inside.",19.01.2012,12.48.49
451CS7,woah holy freaking crap,19.01.2012,12.48.55
451CS7,sage is a computer ghost,19.01.2012,12.49.06
TUTOR,language!,19.01.2012,12.49.07
455CS7,hahaha sarah,19.01.2012,12.49.12
451CS7,sorry,19.01.2012,12.49.16
TUTOR,Discuss the differences between glucose and starch molecules.,19.01.2012,12.49.19
455CS7,What do you mean starch molecules?,19.01.2012,12.49.54
461CS7,it looks like the glucose got out of the bag thing and made the test strip turn green,19.01.2012,12.50.02
455CS7,I agree,19.01.2012,12.50.11
TUTOR,We'll use the tube weight as an indicator for water movement.,19.01.2012,12.50.12
461CS7,ther other thing we where looking at,19.01.2012,12.50.15
TUTOR,We'll also use *glucose test strips* to detect glucose in both environments.,19.01.2012,12.50.16
TUTOR,"<< On the whiteboard, you can see what happened in this setup over time.",19.01.2012,12.50.30
451CS7,yeah i agree as well,19.01.2012,12.50.34
TUTOR,"The results with glucose are different than what you saw with starch - as a team, discuss and agree upon an explanation for these results.",19.01.2012,12.50.54
TUTOR,"Sarah, can you be more specific about what you agree with",19.01.2012,12.51.13
461CS7,cool the longer it is in there it get heivier and more glucose gets out of the thing,19.01.2012,12.51.13
451CS7,guys are we supposed to b filling out the worksheet yet if so wat do yinz got so far,19.01.2012,12.51.38
461CS7,no it is just to guide u i askwed,19.01.2012,12.52.10
455CS7,so instead of the liquid turning a color the strip did and the gluclose gained more weight...,19.01.2012,12.52.13
TUTOR,Can you say more about why it gained weight?,19.01.2012,12.52.37
461CS7,no i think the water and the glucose switched and the water made it get heavie,19.01.2012,12.52.44
TUTOR,"Nice explanation, Summer!",19.01.2012,12.53.08
451CS7,i agree with summer,19.01.2012,12.53.10
461CS7,thank you,19.01.2012,12.53.25
451CS7,your welcome,19.01.2012,12.53.33
TUTOR,Good job on using your accountable talk moves,19.01.2012,12.53.39
461CS7,what about u aklexis,19.01.2012,12.53.46
455CS7,I agree the distilled water probably mixed in the baggey thing and thats why its heavier.,19.01.2012,12.54.18
TUTOR,"Okay, everyone - let's move on to the last experiment.",19.01.2012,12.54.31
461CS7,cool so we all agree,19.01.2012,12.54.32
455CS7,okay,19.01.2012,12.54.38
461CS7,ok,19.01.2012,12.54.42
451CS7,yep,19.01.2012,12.54.42
TUTOR,"In this setup we have glucose solution on the outside, pure water on the inside.",19.01.2012,12.54.52
461CS7,ok,19.01.2012,12.55.00
455CS7,k,19.01.2012,12.55.03
TUTOR,"What changes do you think you'll see in this condition? Agree on a prediction for what you'll observe over time, *and* an explanation that everyone understands.",19.01.2012,12.55.16
451CS7,i think the bag will get lighter,19.01.2012,12.55.22
461CS7,me to i agree with sarah,19.01.2012,12.55.37
455CS7,Same,19.01.2012,12.55.50
451CS7,because in the last bag it got heavier wen the water wz on the outside now its on the inside,19.01.2012,12.56.00
TUTOR,Nice prediction. can you explain why - Alexis?,19.01.2012,12.56.03
451CS7,yeah alexsis,19.01.2012,12.56.13
TUTOR,oh you were quick!,19.01.2012,12.56.18
TUTOR,So can you say more about the movement of water molecules,19.01.2012,12.56.42
461CS7,i think water weighs more then glucose,19.01.2012,12.57.08
451CS7,water molecules are atracted to glucose molecules is that why the bag got heavier last time,19.01.2012,12.57.20
455CS7,The might leak out of the baggey thing,19.01.2012,12.57.25
455CS7,The water,19.01.2012,12.57.30
461CS7,what do u mean alexis,19.01.2012,12.57.40
455CS7,I think the water will leak out of the baggey thing,19.01.2012,12.57.55
TUTOR,Does anyone disagree with Sarah's explanation?,19.01.2012,12.58.10
461CS7,o ok i agree and it will get lighter in the bag,19.01.2012,12.58.19
455CS7,Yes. and I agree with sarah 100%,19.01.2012,12.58.45
451CS7,no i think glucose is thick like the corn syrup which is why it cant leave or come in but water is thinner like the vinegar which is why it can leave or come in whenever it wants,19.01.2012,12.58.50
TUTOR,"Make sure each of you is clear on your team's prediction and explanation, and write it in your worksheet.",19.01.2012,12.58.54
TUTOR,"All right, we're wrapping up. Thanks, team!",19.01.2012,12.59.38
461CS7,i agree with sarahs new thing i think we should write that down,19.01.2012,12.59.39
455CS7,yeah and no problem,19.01.2012,13.00.01
461CS7,the new one she said just now,19.01.2012,13.00.05
TUTOR,"Sarah, you said the glucose would exchange place with the water, but now you're saying the glucose can't come in? Isn't there a contradiction?",19.01.2012,13.00.06
461CS7,what do u guys think the new one or the old one,19.01.2012,13.00.36
451CS7,oh poo i dont know can someone help me,19.01.2012,13.00.44
455CS7,I think she was saying that the gluclose wouldnt be able to come in because its thicker,19.01.2012,13.00.54
451CS7,yeah because the corn syrup couldnt,19.01.2012,13.01.11
TUTOR,So are you saying the glucose strip inside won't change color? What about the glucose strip outside in condition C?,19.01.2012,13.01.33
461CS7,i agree with alexis and what sage just said now i am confused lol,19.01.2012,13.02.18
451CS7,im a little confused too,19.01.2012,13.02.39
451CS7,sage can you help us #orNAW,19.01.2012,13.03.04
461CS7,i hope alexis nows what she is talking about,19.01.2012,13.03.07
455CS7,haha idk lol,19.01.2012,13.03.17
TUTOR,"Sorry, you have to work out the answers and explanations for yourselves",19.01.2012,13.03.32
451CS7,so can we decide on what our predictions are,19.01.2012,13.03.55
455CS7,together as a group,19.01.2012,13.04.07
461CS7,what r we going to say help haha i say we say what sarah said about it not being able to come in lets just scroll up and write that down kk or naw,19.01.2012,13.04.08
451CS7,kk,19.01.2012,13.04.22
461CS7,alexis what u think,19.01.2012,13.04.28
455CS7,I agreed with sarahs first explanation,19.01.2012,13.04.31
TUTOR,"I don't know whether you're right, but sounds like you have a good explanation!",19.01.2012,13.04.51
461CS7,omg haha what one i think the 2 one is write what do u think sarah,19.01.2012,13.04.51
461CS7,what one sage,19.01.2012,13.05.03
451CS7,sage cant give us answers,19.01.2012,13.05.19
461CS7,ok what do u think then lol,19.01.2012,13.05.31
461CS7,what r we going to write,19.01.2012,13.05.39
455CS7,I think we should stick with the first one,19.01.2012,13.05.46
451CS7,alexis are you saying the on were i said water molecules are attracted to glucose molecules,19.01.2012,13.05.53
461CS7,ok,19.01.2012,13.05.53
455CS7,yeah so the baggey would get lighter,19.01.2012,13.06.11
461CS7,ya i got it writin down lol,19.01.2012,13.07.41
461CS7,leaves the room,19.01.2012,13.07.44
451CS7,leaves the room,19.01.2012,13.18.02
455CS7,leaves the room,19.01.2012,13.18.54
TUTOR,leaves the room,19.01.2012,13.22.48
