01.01.1970,00.56.13,553CN7,but when you look at the glucose strip for the initial observation there is already a little bit of glucose present. and as the time goes on the color darkens so wouldn't it be fair to say that the amount of glucose increased?,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

01.01.1970,00.59.30,553CN7,maybe you'll see that the color of the strip changes because the glucose passes through the membrane of the cell therefore decreasing the amount outside and leaving little to none for the indicator to pick up,0,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,1
