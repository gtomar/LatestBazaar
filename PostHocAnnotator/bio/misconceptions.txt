the cell model acts like a sponge
starch moves from higher concentrations to lower concentrations
the water moves toward the glucose
iodine leaves water
[SUBSTANCE] is selectively permeable
condition [ABC] is selectively permeable to [SUBSTANCE]
starch moved out
[SUBSTANCE] gained weight
when glucose moves, the weight changes
the [SUBSTANCE] goes where it is most needed
