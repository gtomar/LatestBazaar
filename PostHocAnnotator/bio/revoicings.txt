in diffusion, molecules move from higher concentration areas to lower concentration areas
molecules move down the concentration gradient
whether they start on the inside or the outside, the water and the glucose will balance out
no matter how you do it, the water and the glucose will most likely balance out
everything will tend toward equilibrium
molecules are always moving randomly
molecules keep on moving even after equilibrium is reached
the starch molecules are too big to pass through the membrane
the membrane is selectively permeable to glucose, but not to starch
the membrane is selectively permeable
the membrane is permeable to glucose and water
the membrane is permeable to water
the membrane is permeable to iodine
the membrane is not permeable to starch
iodine can be used to detect the presence of starch
when iodine and starch mix, they turn purple
iodine turns purple when starch is there
the iodine passed through the membrane and mixed with the starch
starch molecules are too big to pass through the membrane
starch molecules are more complex than glucose molecules
glucose molecules are small enough to pass through the membrane
iodine molecules can pass through the membrane
water molecules can pass through the membrane
if water enters the cell, it gains weight
if water leaves the cell, it loses weight
the tube gets heavier if water flows in but not out
the tube gets lighter if water flows out but not in
a glucose strip changes color when glucose is there
a glucose strip changes from yellow to green when glucose is there
the glucose strip and the iodine are both used as indicators
the membrane keeps the starch concentration from changing much
the size of the membrane pores regulates the concentration of starch
selective permeability regulates what can go in and out of a cell
osmosis is when water goes from higher concentration to lower concentration
the starch won't pass through the membrane
equilibrium is maintained by diffusion
the water and glucose will balance themselves out
when there's glucose inside, some goes out while water comes in
when glucose is outside, some goes in and water comes out
the membrane is permeable to iodine and water
things go from higher concentration to lower concentration when they can
the membrane reacts differently to different molecules
the cell won't let big molecules pass through
diffusion takes time
the membrane is not permeable to complex molecules
the longer the cell model sits in the environment, the more the weight will change
iodine can pass through the cell membrane
the water was clear because nothing else was mixed with it
the starch must not have left the cell because the water stayed clear
the membrane lets some things pass in and out of the cell
the dialysis tube gained weight
the indicator on the inside changed color 
the indicator on the outside changed color
you can prove that there was a change in concentration 
colors can help indicate if molecules have moved
glucose will make the indicator strip darker
starch will make the iodine darker
the glucose can pass through the cell membrane
the cell membrane is permeable to glucose
the cell membrane will not let starch pass through
water molecules moved between the two environments
molecules will move to the area of lower concentration if they can
the membrane is selectively permeable to some molecules
water will be able to get in but the starch won't be able to move out
