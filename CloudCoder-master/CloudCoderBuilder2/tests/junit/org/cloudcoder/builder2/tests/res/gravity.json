Because\nthe building is on Earth, accelaration due to gravity should be \npart of your calculations (i.e., assume 9.8 m\/s^2 as the <em>G<\/em> \nconstant). To make the calculation reasonable, assume the \nbuilding is infinitely tall and located in a vacuum on Earth\n(i.e., ignore any forces due to friction, air-resistance, etc.).\n<\/p>\n\n<p>\nReturn the number of meters the object has fallen after \n<code>time<\/code> seconds have elapsed when the object is \nthrown with given initial velocity.\n<\/p>\n","skeleton":"def gravity (time, initalVelocity):\n    \"\"\"\n    return float indicating number of meters an object has fallen \n    after being thrown with an initial velocity (given in meters per\n    second) and after falling for time seconds\n    \"\"\"\n    # TODO: complete code here\n    ","schema_version":4,"author_name":"Kannan Raju","author_email":"kr88@duke.edu","author_website":"","timestamp_utc":1378456148639,"license":1,"parent_hash":"","external_library_url":"","external_library_md5":""},"test_case_data_list":[{"test_case_name":"t0","input":"0, 0","output":"0","secret":false},{"test_case_name":"t1","input":"1, 1","output":"5.9","secret":false},{"test_case_name":"t2","input":"1, 5","output":"9.9","secret":false},{"test_case_name":"t3","input":"3, 5","output":"59.1","secret":false},{"test_case_name":"t4","input":"3, 0","output":"44.1","secret":false},{"test_case_name":"t5","input":"3200, 0","output":"50176000.0","secret":false},{"test_case_name":"t6","input":"86400, 0","output":"36578304000.0","secret":false},{"test_case_name":"t7","input":"12.5, 20","output":"1015.625","secret":false},{"test_case_name":"t8","input":"12.5, 200","output":"3265.625","secret":false},{"test_case_name":"t9","input":"12.5, 2000","output":"25765.625","secret":false}]}
