  Notes:              modified load LoadTesterTask/PlayEditSequence to add a
                      0-10 second random delay prior to login (to avoid a
                      thundering herd situation), and to retry all RPC
                      operations (up to 3 attempts total)

  Notes:              CPU utilization around 40% (bursting to 50%): workload on
                      webapp/MySQL enough to saturate one CPU core.  From running
                      top, the webapp and MySQL seem to be consuming CPU about
                      equally.  The build server is quite heavily loaded (close
                      to 100% CPU utilization); should try experiment using
                      multiple build servers.

  Notes:              Very slow to start up, java (webapp) process consuming near 100%

                      EC2?  Upgrade to more recent version of Jetty?
                      During the run CPU utilization is more reasonable.
                      Interestingly, mysql CPU utilization remains fairly low.

                      is extremely high in the startup phase.  Need to investigate.
                      Perhaps some of it is the requests for the Javascript code
                      and other static resources?

    THIS SEEMS TO HAVE ELIMINATED THE HIGH CPU LOAD ON STARTUP!!!
    The change was to reduce the bcrypt log2 hash rounds from 12 to 10
    (10 is the default, but we were using 12.)
    The median delay for polling for a submission result seems high:
    perhaps more build server capacity is needed?

    One change to load tester: clients call getProblemText() on the
    EditCodeService to get the initial problem text.
    It seems as though for this many clients 24 builder cores is
    insufficient.  Need to try more.  Also, setting bcrypt log2 rounds to 10
    still causes a significant CPU spike as the clients log in.
    Try going down to 9 or 8.

    Wow, the **single core** server at DigitalOcean easily handles the
    load for the 700 user test.  Login delay is noticibly higher, although
    with 700 users logging in within a 15 second window, not unexpected,
    and probably not something that would happen in practice.
    This is a $10/month server!
