the weak intermolecular interaction force is a big contributor for nonpolar molecules
dipole energy is the main contributor for polar molecules
dispersion forces are a primary consideration for nonpolar molecules
ionic molecules boiling points are affected by the distance between them
molecular size has a big effect on nonpolar boiling points
intermolecular surface area affects boiling point
in non-polar molecules, the only force at work is the dispersion force
more branches limit the ability of molecules to interact across large surface areas
reduced surface area interaction results in a lower boiling point
ionic substances are held together by coulomb forces
coulomb force varies inversely with the sum of the radii
electrons are not shared equally in ionic compounds
ionic interactions are dominated by coulomb forces
dipole moment has little to no influence on ionic compounds
the key factor is the charge of the ions
boiling point increases with inter-ion forces
all else being equal, larger molecules have higher boiling points
the influence of dipole moment tends to be outweighed by dispersion
all else being equal, higher dipole moment means higher boiling point
hydrogen bonds can lead to higher boiling points
branched isomers have lower boiling points than non-branched isomers
substituting more electronegative atoms means higher dipole moment
dispersion forces increase with surface area
the dipole moment is related to the angle between atoms
the dipole moment increases with the angle between atoms
dispersion forces can outweigh dipole-dipole interactions
dispersion forces can be large enough to dominate the boiling point considerations
dispersion forces can be dominated by ionic interactions
polarizable molecues can have higher boiling points
substituting larger atoms increases the van der waals area
