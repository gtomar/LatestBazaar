i dont think so
ok just the 2 of us Xd
YAY
haha
hi sage
SAGE
we dont have a pic
were not special
Bwahahahahahahahahha
my name is kyrsten
hi im jeremy big anime fan kyrsten
okie dokie
so lets say the white cat is Cc and the orange is CC
CC
CC=50%
Cc=50%
cc=0%
SO all the children would be CC
or just Cc
yea the geno types would be tht and the phenotypes would be that all of them are orange. can't produce a perfect white cat
yes because CC is more dominant through them
yes because if 2 different cats produce more cats theyre not gonna be either all white or all orange
so its 100% for all Gg meaning its heterozygous
well the genotype for this is like a 50 50 because since its Gg it can be white or orange
agreed
:)
but tyhe capital G is half orange lower g is half white
since theirs 2 white cats the daddy has to be white because 2 orange cats dont have the genes for that
the daddy could be a recessive orange and white cat because a dominant orange wouldnt be able to have white babies
no what im trying to say is their has to be a white cat or their be no white kittens
i agree with kyrsten
they dont have to be white, they just have to have the gene that makes them partially white
yes because it would be reccesive or just a heterozygous
so then kyrsten that would mean the daddy is heterozygous
thats what im thinking
if its homozygus then it would only be one color
this i9s true because since their are 2 white cats and more orange cats the dad will be Gg since the mom is GG
so the mystery father was orange
homozygous is when yu have the same gene..like GG could be homozygous..i think thats how it is
oh i meant to say heterozygous my bad XD
heterozygous genotypes are just genes that are lower case or capitasl (example. Gg)
one parent can be GG the other could be Gg
yes. theyre not sharin genotypes with the children so i have to look more at phenotypes
i agree with kyrsten because she has a good point since 50% are white and 50 % are orange i think it would be just GG for both parents
but if it was Gg it would be equal since its half and half
i can agree on jeremys idea
ok so if you put Gg on both sides of the scare you would get 1 GG and 2 Gg 1gg

Hi Candace
hello fidelis!
= )
ehat are we doing ?
what8
idk yet
this needs to start i want to get out of here
ikno
this is stupid -_-
lol
hi
hola
ok
so is orange dominant >
yea i think that the orange is dominant over white
This all depends on which color is dominant
that why i asked if orange was dominant
i think so
yes
soo if orange is dominant and whites recessive they will make orange babies and they would be heterozygous
yes thats what im thinking
dominant beats recessive
soo they are 100% heterozygous soo orange babies!
yes
GG*gg= Gg
yes
we've figured that out sage
well one is heterozygous
the orange might be "Gg" and the white could be "gg"
agreed
but who's the dad ?
I think the white would actually be "GG"
or wait no, i thought that through wrong lol
the whits recessive how can it be GG
you guys are right
sooo whos the daddy
we cant pick the things up and check
im pretty sure the white is the dad
idk im trying to figure that out
it could be true because Gg*Gg = GG gg and Gg
Ohhhhh I see it. 3/4 of them are going to be orange since theres only one recssive box
si
i agree with tyler
the genotypes are Gg and gg
One of them is heterozygous and the other is homozygous recssive
i think that its Gg and the other one is gg
yes
so its all agreed.
i said it was heterozygous because that they would have a 50% chance with the 2 colors
yes
yay!
Yeah because the mixes would be GG,GG, gg, gg
i agre
agree
noo it would Gg Gg and gg gg
yes
i mean candace
Oh yeahhh. You;re right
*you're
mhmm
so one is heterozygous orange and the other one white
yeeep

Hi im brigid!
aa Aa
HI GUYS I'M MIRANDA AND I LIKE TO EAT COOKIE DOUGH ON THURSDAYS(:
IM Jacob! in a high pitched voice
otay
i think its aa A a
ok so i think the top 2 are aa and the side 2 are AA
YES I agree
ok makes sense
AA and Aa
wheres are picture?
lmfao!
i want my mommy
It cant be AA because the other one was pure white
leaves the room
bt wheres the pic
sagey come back, you can blame it all on me
baby come back
hahahahhaha
its back!
hey we have a pic again
i was right!
yayyyyyyyy!
lol yes
and jordan just left us
i know right
meow meow meow meow meow meow meow meow meow meow omeow mewoewrwewmwowoenrfwema,erg!
but anyways, pure white=aa
then dark=AA
yes so the white is recessive gg
the white cat is aa and the orange is AA
the dominant is GG or orange the recessive is gg
YES
yes !
yesssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssss
yes!
Aa
and Aa
yea so the orange is Aa
i agreee!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Gg and GG
im bored
can i have some candy
do the penguins suck?
nooooooooo
guys back on topic
pleaaasssee
and the dad is a orange Gg
ok it has to be Aa and Aa so theres a 1/4 chance on getting a white cat
ok so the #2 parents are Gg and gg
no
yes my bad
because there is a white cats
because doing the math in the punnet squares, only one of the squares should have aa
i have no idea
the rest should be Aa
really
i agree
so thats it?
i guess and pleeasssee can i have candy the penguins dont suck
i think this one is Aa and Aa
the parents could be Gg and GG????? idk
for half and hlaf
i thkink one is gg and the other is GG
^yes
and the other is
Gg
yeeee
AHHH SHE KNOWS MY NAME ?! but yeah i guess. and yeah jacob thats what i said!
blah
GG on the side and gg on top so it would all be Gg
but the cats are white
and orange
The parents are GG and Gg i think . They are because the orange is GG and the white is Gg.
yeah, half of them are so Gg so its a 50/50 chance
or maybe they are gg and GG
so wouldnt it be Gg and Gg
I QUIT
they cant bee gg and GG cuz there is white
so its GG and gg right ?
the white is gg
no
Gg and gg i thinkl
yeah!

Hii jackie
Hi i'm Taylor
i think its aa Aa
Hello you guys!
the top cat in homosygous recessive the side cat is homozygous dominant
white kitten is heterozygous and the orange kitten is homozygous dominant
hi but im sure the top 2 are aa becaue it it was aa it would Aa or AA it wounld be brown
yep
Yes]BACKSLASH
the side is AA or Aa
i thik its aa on top and AA on the side
white cat aa, orange cat AA
the side is AA and the top is Aa making the probability to have the orange kittens 75%
ok the orange is GG, the white is gg
so im guessing it was AA Aa?
yes jackie thats y its !))% orange cats cause of the domanit trait
1005 i mean
yeah
The orange cat has a homozygous dominant, and the white cat has a homozygous recessive, therefore making the the children only be able to be oragne, because thats the dominant trait
Yep
i agree
a white cat
The top is aa and the side it Aa
so its a 50% chance they will have brown and white cats
the top is Aa and the side is Aa
yes
i think taylors right it could be Aa Aa
I agree with what Taylor G said, about the top being Aa and the side being Aa
me too
so that their is a probability of a white cat to be reproduced, there has to be a 50% chance of it happening
For the 25% chance of having a white cat, that must be true
I agree
yeah i agree to
it occurs in a lot of cases
what do we do nest?
next
Idk but we have 2 min
ok
Aa and Aa becaus its a %0 % chabnce3 that they will be wicht and brown considering half are brown and half are white
50%
i think that also

Hey guysssss
hiii autumn.
Hi Gorgeous
hoitz
i dont know what we're doing.
hi anthony, & me either... what does hoitz mean?
nothing... for now
ooh, what's the point of this then.
okay.. la la loopsy la la loopsy
idk its FOR SCIENCE
so i guess we are trying to figure ou the traits of the parent cats. the orange one has the dominant trait for orange fur and it dominates over the cat with white fur so the possible gene combinations is Ff & ff or FF & ff
gene
F being the orange fur trait and f being the white fur trait
the white kitten is heterozygous and the orange one is homozygous domanint so there was no chance of a white kitten in there litter
the orange cat is homozygous dominant.
no, they arent if the dominant trait is present in every outcome, there is no chance of the cats to come out with white fur
if it has a dominant triat then yes.
I agree jordan & both parents dont have to have orange fur for 100% of their offspring to be orange
all there litter will be heterozygous
To have a littler of mixed breeds both parents must be heterozygous.
heterozygous is when the cats genes are one dominant and one recessive
no
The children inherit one gene from their mom, and one from their dad.
yes.
i agree with jordo :) the phenotype of the mother can be Ff & the father could be Ff or the mother can be Ff & the father can be ff
yes
but in this case the orange cat is heterozygous and the white cat could be homo or heterozygous most likely hetero
yes
if their both heterozygous they are both orange because of the dominant trait, but can have white children because of the ressive trait they have.
i agree
I agree & if one of the parents were white they would be homozygous recessive and then their children would have the chance to have white and orange fur
yes if the both of them carry a recessive trait but if one parent is homozygous dominant then all their cats will have the same color fur as them
the parent would have to be one heterozygous orange cat and one homozygous white cat
the genotype of the mom would have to be GG and the genotype of the dad would be gg.
that way theres a 50/50 chance of having either white or orange litter
there is more than one type of combination from the parents for their offspring to have white and orange fur
and in the picture it shows a total of eight kittens and four of them are white, four of them are orange. which is 50/50.
i disagree because then would all be heterozygous and would all be orange
it depends on the genes of the cat. if one is homozygous and the other is heterozygous it can have both white and orange kittens.
well one parent can have one dominant trait and the other parent can have one dominant trait and their offspring has a 25% chance of their offspring getting the recessive trait
That's true.
but if one is homo dominant and one is homo ressicive then they would be 100% orange heterozgous

what is the question
this is d-lo
the orange cat is OO
well the parent on the left is probably homozygous dominant and the top is homozygous reccesive
the white cat is Oo
no the white cat cant be Oo
he would be orange
Or the kids would be white
oo
yeah
lets gooo
i was right lol
hotdawg
no you werent me n graham were
wheres the questions at
what do we do next
thats what we were supposed to type?
Well its also homozygous recessive
gg
They both have heterozygous genenotypes
But the cat on the left would be heterozzygous or what samone said
yerrp
i can't b or the orange cat would be white
YERRP
yerrp
the cat on the left can be Gg because white fur is recessive
imma a beast
25% of the cats would be white
Because if they can have a homozygous dominant and homozygous recessive then it has to be
75 orange
you are a copy cat lol get it
750000 orange
oh wow..
shut up
now what
yerrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrp
It would be what i said earlier, on would be heterozygous the other homozygous recessive
probably
It has to be though because if you think about it then theres no other way
It would be 50 50 like the offsprings
right
it would be homozygous dominant and heterozygous
So the phenotype would turn out 50/50
Homo zygous recessive. It would be easier to show on the square
yerp
the orange cat would be homzyfous dominant and the white cat is heterozygous
No because orange is dominant
hetero and homorecessive
yeah homozygous dominant
But the hetero would make up for that with Aa
I think that it would be heterozygous, and homozygous reccesive
would that be right
Well then their both hetero. I mean this is isnt really fair it could of always been that but the most logical thing would be hetero and homorecessive
no there would be an aa

I KNOW WHO THE BABY DADDY IS!!!!!! (MAURY MAURY MAURY)
I'
Im Andrew
I'm Heather(:
shanquail
Okay
what is the question
ummm The orange cat has the dominant trait
yes its shown on the diagram
Okay well the Cat on the top of the square is an albino cat and the other is brown and since there is no pigment in the albino cat the browm fur automaticaly becomes the dominat trait
They could produce this litter of kittens from the mom or dad being orange.
I think that could be correct.
but all eight of the children are brown/orange so its the dominant trait
Yeah, because remeber the brown bunny n the white bunny a brown and white bunny can never have a white offspring
YERP
no, because the pigment in the albino cat is 0 the brown becomes the dominat trait
but it is possible that the dominant triat doesn't mean anything and the cats take the recessive trait.
And since the brown cat holds the dominant trait there is no chance of them ever having an albino cat and the punnet squares prove this
Thats what i said
the daddy is albino and holds the recessive trait
But there wouldnt b any white cats because the dominat trait takes over
The genenotype of the mystery parent is Gg,Gg
i think
but this is a different problem and there is still a chance that the bunny can be albino
not really because if the brown is a dominat trait then it takes over
He cariied the trait for albino but it didnt show
but still there are two albino baby bunnies
ohhhh i get what you are sayong he carried it through his geno type
yes but it can always be an unexpected turn for the worst and the white trait is the color they will inherit.
Well the both carrie the trait for being albino
yes thats how twins are
Yes, sort of, like they can carry a certain trait but no show it and pass it on to their offspring
What Shut Up
I don't look anything like my sister and we have the same mom and dad
Gg gg
Gg gg
i agree
I understand that one of the parents is albino and the other is brown
Because there would be half a chance that they get the recessive tria (gg) and half they get a heterozygus (G,g
Big Meach
Larry Hover
Whipping work
They have a 50/50 chance of being white or brown
Haleighluia
Well theres 8 babies half came out albino there was half a chance they could have recived that trait
Yes
Because they get their traits from their parents so you can see from them

HIIII guys, im bree. this is amandaaaaaa
Hey
oh my amanda is here!?!/
yeshhhhh she is. we are sharringggg
okaaaaay
the orange cat has the dominant traut, seeing that the kittens are orange
Well, since all of the kittens are orange, oraange fur must be the dominant trait, so the orange parent is homozygous dominant, and the white one is homozygous recessive, making all the kittens heterozygous.

hmmmm agreed
i agree zach.
Oh, hey, the answer popped up on-screen
yesss answersssssssssss!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
i seeeeeeeee
no just kidding i knew all of this
so it makes no
difference
same here jade, it was pretty obvious who the paremts areeee
PUT ONE OF EACH LETTER FOR GOD'S SAKE!!!!!
yessss
<sigh>
mwahahaha
soooooooooo are we supposed to get rid of the other cat thing?
orrr what?
idunno...im just leaving it.
The orange cat is probably Gg, while the missing one is either Gg or gg
i think the white cat has the full recessive traits, being white
zach...the missing cat is gg
lets test it on the square
Oh, there's more orange cats than white!!
because he has the genes of either making 1/4 of the kittens whitee
Gg and gg, so that the square is 50/50
i was gunna say that!!!!!
stealing my thoughts
one parent is orange, the other is white. having both of these parents being opposite colors, then they produce the kittens, having a 50/50 chance of being each color.
I hear voices in your head :P
waaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah
Responding to Jade, who thought i was reading her mind

Hi
hiii
why do you guys think it is like this
I think the white one would be Aa and the orange one is AA
i agree with u alexis
who cares at all says blly
billy*
what do u think maria?
ed says hi
the orange cat is homozygous dominatnt
i agree.
i agree too
and the children are heterozygoussss
it says that the childen are probly GG ot Gg
I think the da's geno type is Gg
i think the dada is a white cat with GG or Gg
i agree.
the orange cat is the same thing GG or Gg
the dad cat is probably homomzygous ressissivd
only if you have a visual of the children too
depends
i agree wiht alexis and sage
because the orange cat is homozygous dominatnt
because there arent just orange kittens there are also white onles
soo are both of the cats orange so to get a white one they have to be Gg
what do you guys think we should say
one is orange and one is white
i agree maria
with the genotype of Gg
i think the one on the side is GG and the one on the top is gg
y do you think that
because half are white and the other half are orange.
i agree i didnt see the new picture that poped up so i agree now
okay good lol
so are we going to say
yeah if everyone agrees
yeaah

ok wat do u guys think
i think that the wight cat is ressesive
yes i do too wut bout u ason
and the tan cat is homogygus dominate
making all there children heterozygos
yea, and da yellow/ orange is heterozygous and/or homozygous dominante
no edds right
no, i think not
ok ur both r right
no i was right
o ok ik u r
do you understand now ason
yea u were, fn genius
yeaaaaaaaaa
no he doesnt hes slow
whatever
Dustin lets not name call
ok srry wat r we supposed to do now
oh ok so the childern are heterozygous
the orange cat is heterozygous
......
o ok each cat is orange n is hterozygous
the parents both have to have at least one ressesive genotype
and i think the white is the same, cuz it woudlnt make since any other way
yea ik they do
.
do u agree: Genuis
yea with edd
because two of the children r recessive
he must be heterozygous because he needs at least one ressesive trait to have a wight cat so he cant be homozygous domnate
i said the same thing as ed, but this is true, becuz the only way that both yellow and white cats could come out is if both parents were heterozygous
ya what ason said.
yea true
and also, like dustin was saying 2 chilren are recessive
ok!BACKSLASH
ok
so there is an equal amount of wight and tan cats
the phenotype has to be 50 50
wich 1 r we on????
yea thats true
i got it
one parent has to be homozygous ressesive and the other is heterozygous
y do they just asking
the would have children with a 50 50 chance of being tan or wight
o ok i see ur right
i think that 1 parent is homozygous recessive, and the other 1 is dominate, wat yall said is wrong
y do u think that ason
cuz there is 8 chrildren, 4 tan 4 white.......
%50 for a heterozygouse %50 for homozygous ressesive
yea like edds saying
so 1 parent has to b homozygous dominate, and 1 has 2 be recessive
if 1 parent ws homozygous and the other is homozygous recessive
that wouldnt make since
you would have all heterozygous children
yea Genuis
the phenotype of being tan
no problem
wait yea ur rite, ok
jeez ason get wit the program

dont judge
yeah
we got that Sage
yeah
thank you
ok
whos your daddy
i think its a white kat
i think the dad is a recessive
i say that both parents are Gg
i agre
ya
yes
yup
i think that the brown cat is Gg and the dad is gg
ya
no
wait
ya both Gg
because gg would take up 50%
the brown kat is Gg
ya mark
and ricky
both of the parents are Gg
yes
ya
just the dad is obviously white
ya
because the white fur is gg so in order for the parents to get a white kat or two
they would both need to be heterozygous
because 2 out of 8 is 25%
its when a person has a dominant trait and recessive
ya
yes
and it works in this problem because they have a 25% chance for a white cat
yup
and 75% brown cat
yup
which is exactly the diagram of the kid cats
yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
hahha
hm
well one must be Gg and another must be gg because it will equal 50% for both
the white cat has GG and the brown cat has gg
i think
ya mark i agree
no ricky
try putting theletters on the diagram
ohhhhh ya i agree wit mark
same
yoooo, this group is crush
yeah
we get the explanation
yea
it would be a 50% chance for dominant and recessive
yup
i agreee
cause Gg= dominant trait
yes
ya
dominant genes can be GG or Gg
yup
wait, what does sage mean by expressed
idk
i dont get his question
can someone put his question in words id understand?
thts kinda hard to do
haha yeah true ricky
i just dont get what he means by the genes are expressed
well you know can you tell us if dominant genes can be expressed
no problem
we got it right
ya we did
ok i get it
good job guys
ya ya ya ya ya ya ya

HI
yay.
hi
SAGE IS GOING TO HURT ME
its not ason :D
lets work to get the food
there's food?!
yes if we work well we get food
idgaf about food
yes you do >:|
sage what are we doing
we haveto figure out how they can have all kittens as orange fur
the wo kats had a 50 50 chanche of having yellow children and they got very very very lucky
sage what are you wearing?
well it is homozygous so.
lol
no its heterozygous
oh explain
i think one would be heterozygous and one homozygous
or no
yea the white is recessive n the oprange is homozygous dominant tits thaat easy
its not tits
nice way to spell oranges and what about tits
lol
SPELL RIGHT YOU FOOLS
shut up you know what i mean. do you understand arianna
yes XD
se his name babela n he mak shap
sage we think that they had a 50/50 chance of being yellow or white
weve been over this sage LEAVE US ALONE
a heterozygous white cat?
the genotype was homozygous what do you guys think
the mom is Aa n the dad is Aa
or a heterozygous orange cat. im not sure
i agree
yea raise both your arms so i can ee
sage we all agree now next question please
if you agree
yep, i agree
i agree next question please sage
right sage hello?
sage?
and now the waiting game.
:D
ooooo im right
so 25% can be white kittens
good job you guys lets keep it up
its true because the kids have a one forth chance of being white and two of them are out of eight so ithat in a fraction is one fourth
white 25% orange 75%.
hello sage
okay
ok
one is homozygous dominant and the other is heterozygous
what are you guys thinking
aa
no not that
oh wait
yea its aa n Aa
OH I KNOW
yeah
aa and Aa.
i think its big a little a because i see a 50/50 chance here from the amount of kids
one of the parents is homozygous resessive and the other is heterozygouus
why mark
i know how to explain
we do
wed have to use the board
because it would make the outcome 50 50


sorry :(
stop mark we lose points for that
it was an accident i was seeing what the button does next to the chat
we were right
yea ik
oh wait
i meant to say Aa
but yeah
yea were right
i said big a little a so we were right
sweet
we did it
yay
babila i have something to confess
i hate this keyboard, its hard to type on it D:
what to confess

hi taylor and zack
im taylor {: hi jen and zack
so all the children are orange like the one parent
they have the same trait as the one parent
well i am not sure if both pparents have the same genotype becuase they only look like one parent not both
the yellow cat must be homozygous dominant? and the other one is homozygous recessive?
yeah
yesi ageree with you taylor
because the parent that is homozygous recessive doesnt look like the children so the children must have the homozygous dominant trait
no
no
taylor can you explain more i am not sure how to
the children take after the yellow cat
i agree taylor
the children dont look like a combination of both
yes. the children must have a big "G" to look the same
the kids take after the yellow cat and the yellow cat thats the parent is homozygous dominant
yes taylor i agree. so the cat with the white fur will be homozygous recessive
yes(:
yes :)
zack any input?
nope
should we move on to #2.?
the missing parent would have to be homozygous recessive and the other will be heterozygous
yeah what i just said is to #2
why? can you explain please because i am not positive
ohh, both parents will have to be heterozygous
so 25% of the children will have white fur. but what trait is that ahain.?
im not understanding what you mean? i just know that 25% of the children have white fur
they are both heterozygous
are we going to #3 now.?
so 50% of the children will be heterozygous recessive and the other 50% will be heterozgous dominant
i agree jenn
i understand
so taylor we both agree that it will be 50% dominant and 50% recessive but what about the parents what will they be? will one be white and one orange.?
zack any input.?
no but i do agree
one will be homozygous recessive and the other will be heterozygous
ohhhh ok that makes sense now
welcome (: bye guys
so 50% will be heterozygous then will the other 50% be recessive or dominant.?
taylor dont leave yet.!! haha
that was my last question
recessive
ok thank you for clearing that up
no problem

Hii
hi
heyy
?
the orange cat is AA and the white cat is aa
the yellow cat is homozygous dominamt
dominant*
idk it could b either way i just said it like that
Yeah because the orange cat has dominant traits
yea the orang got AA cuz all the kittens all are orange
any clue?
About what?/
white fur phenotype is recessive
these cats
yea whit fur is aa while orange fur is AA
the dad is the orange cat
it would have to have atleast one heterzygous parent
wouldnt both the parents have to heterzygous?
the white cat is homozygous then
cuz the only way to have a whit cat is to ha gg traits and thats found in two heterzygous parents
white*
i'm confused ya'll
have*
what you confused abt ??
all this
i dont even know what this stuff means
the answer is aa and Aa i think ,
Aa and Aa
no cuz the aa would only have a chance of 25%
there's four cats that are orange and four that are white
so it would be half
aa and Aa have a 50 50 chance i think
I think that would be right then landon
i agree with landon
me too
Does that help?
fuck no
ahaha
that was James
yeah it helped me ,
ok so does it jessi
Oh gosh i hope i dont get in trouble for this. lmao.
i dont think you will.
That's good then

ya ok
haha
i was just playing it was anita
in #2 3/4 of the cats are dominant
in #3 the chances of the kittens being recessive & dominant are both 50%
yea that's true unless the kitten cheated on him wit tha milkman
yea james!
i mean milk kitten**
#3 the parents would be Gg
jordan which one is the dominant and which color cat is the recessive
i think the orange cat is dominant
white cat is recessive
lol it's a ginger cat

hey girrrlll
my name is robert i am squishy
leaves the room
i think that the yellow goldish cats are the dominant trait because the kittens are yellow, am i correct
yes
joins the room
am i right
one parent has to be homozygous dominanat and the other has to be homozygour recessive to create a whole litter that would be orange
that is what i said the orange cats are dominant
the dad is heterozygous
the daddy is the white cat
because two orange cats cannot have a white fur cat
correct?
yes that is what i am saying
both parents have to be heterozygous
soo next problem cause i think i am right
sure
both parents arent heretozygous . white kittay is homozygous recessive and the tan kittay is homozygouys dominat !!!!!
because if hes heterozygous and the mom is heterozygous also, that would create a 25% chance that the children could be white
the daddy is heterozygous recessive
GG, Gg
GG is daddy, Gg is mommy
one parent is homozygous recessive and the other is heterozygous (gg, Gg)
noooo i think that the daddy is homozygous dominant and the mommy is heterozygous dominant. GG, Gg
50% of the children are white so if one parent is gg and the other is Gg then this will create a 50% chance of having white babies
yeah
noooooooooo
nothing she dont care

father is heterozygous
one dominant gene and one ressesive gene so all the children are dominant. or somehting like that. the orange is the "daddy"
yes
what do the rest of you think about this.
#NAME?
YOU ARE NO HELP !! -_________-
lol no duh idk wat im doing
yes
just say yes
ok yes
he doesnt have to be heterozygous he could be homozygous dominant.
im done saying more i told you what the answer is.
3 times
Gg and Gg
because 50% are white and 50% are orange.
wheres my prize
Gg and gg

how do we edit these?
Click the box with the A i think
how is this even possible? wouldnt all the children be AA
since the dominant is obviously the colored cat
the whit cat has a Aa and the other one has AA the cap A is the dominet
no im not saying that, im saying, wouldnt the dominant gene be the colored orange cat? since all the children are orange
I agree with Courtney
i agree with you to
so would all of the 4 boxes be Gg?
yeah
of corse that is what it says
ok :p
Wouldent it be gg?
what would be? the top parent?
Yeah
i think its the top parent, and then the orange parent would be GG?
oooor Gf?
Gg*
the top cat is Gg becuse if the Orange cat is allso Aa and there are 2 white cats there cant be An G in it
so its Gg and Gg for both parents?
Yeah. I think so.
are one of you typing it in?
Im not.
ya
oh ojk
it is me
ok so we agree on how that is?
Yeah.
i agree
the father is heterozgous because if he was not there would not be 2 differint colors.
wouldnt both the parents be Gg?
since its like equally, i guess.
yes the kids have combos of the parents
so they would bothe be Gg?
yes
OOOOR one could be GG and the other could be gg
if not there would be only 1 color
no becuse if it was the G is the Dominet trat
Since its a 50% chance that the kittens could be white or orange then the square would have big Gs in two squares and two little gs in two squares...
Yes.
so do we all agree on Gg and Gg?
Since half of their children are orange.
no i do not agree it is gg Gg
what do you think sarah?
I think its GG, gg.
i agree with sarah
becuase if there would be two many dominet it would only have 25% to get a wight cats
And with gg and Gg it hase 50%
do we agree on that now
no joe because its all equally split up, its GG and gg
no becaus then there will alwas be a
Dominet trat in each so there will alwas be a orange cat
are we done now?
yes now there is alwas a orange cat
it has to be Gg gg
no joe
its GG and gg
I think were done.
ok exit out now

that clearly gives us 100% to get a orange cat

Um... Hi I'm Nick. :3
jenna
joins the room
if the orange is dominent
The White cat could have the recessive trait... which is White Fur... The orange cat would have the dominant trait.
Which is Orange fur...
so orange could be eather AA or Aa
wow hacker
Yup... Orange cat is GG and the white is gg... and one gene from each cat come together and create Gg... :D
*comes
okay next
yes we see'
the dad is white
so the dad has a gg genotype
The father would obviously have the genotype of gg
this is what i said
jenna stop
no
I was 11 seconds late. -_-
haha lame
thats is one possible anser
awnser*
there is only a 2 white & all the rest are orange
i beleve that there would be one homozigous ressice and one hetero zygus cat so they each would be half and half
Imma just give the statistic that 2/8 babies have the recessive trait of white fur... Meaning that both parents have the trait Gg...
GG gg. its a 50/50 chance
i agree with howie
booya
Okay...
I agree. :P
are we done?

hey sage
heelllo sagee
Okay Now i believe that this will be AA and aa
The orange cat is AA
All the kitties are orange
i agree
The white cat will have the recessive trait which is white fur, and the orange cat would have the dominant trait
i think the orange kittyy is AA because thats the dominant
I agree
The orange cat parent is GG and the white one is gg
I believe they will be mixed with dominant and recessive because the parents are different
buut the dominant trait wil take over wont it ?
I agree, GG and gg will combine to make Gg.
Yepp
whose da baby daddy
the father would have genotype
i agree with ashley !
I also agree with ashely
the father would have gg
ashley*
i agreee
Sage what do we do now.
come on sage . -___-
Because some cats are white
the father would heterozygous recessive
no im saying one of the parents must be white to make white children
The parent is white so they have achnace of being white
a chance*
i agree with katey
SAGE I HAVE NO IDEAD WHAT YOURE TALKING ABOUT
Gg and gg
both genotypes would be heterozygous to get the mix of the cats
the genotype of the parents are heterozygous
ithink
Oh then ashley and tori are right.
I do. i see what they're talking about.
i understand my teams explantion
they are tori but they are recessive and dominant, both parents have the Gg
explanation**
ohh okay ashley (:
thanks
sage we win
?? hopefully !
i wonder what color babies woul come out with the 2 orange parents
with two orange parents will make orange babies becuase they share dominant traits

The white cat has to have the recessive trait and the Orange cat carries the dominant trait the white cat's genotype is aa and the orange cat's genotype would have to be AA meaning the kids are Aa Heterozygous.
yaaa bobby good stuff
Ok JTeeeeeeeeeeeeeee

Bur!
you love cats robert?
yea james
mrs. redd is in the building
and shes armed with an m16 lololol
The genotype of the mystery parent is gg and the orange parent is Gg.?
yeah
ok.
sounds right
i wonder if sage loves cats like you bob
That doesn't make any sence.
yep
Both parents would have to be heterozygous to get a white cat our of the mix
they would both have to be heterozygous Gg right?
Where's #3?
idk mine ran away
ok.
I don't understand because there isn't a #3.

Hi c:
hi kid
helloooo
whoe ali
aliciaBACKSLASH
ooooooo sorry
the orange cat in AA the white cat is aa
the cat that is orange is the dominant
I think the orange cat will be dominate
ya
So there wouldn't be white cats?
all the kittens would be orange bc the orange trait is domanite
i was doing the same thing you just did
wht alicia said
yes
yeah
there is 100% chance the cats will be orange
the mystory cat is Aa
i need 2 now who is dominant
no
not really.
i think it will be a orange cat because most of the children r orange
beacuse there are to white kittens
There's two white kittens so there would have to be someone responsable for it.
yeah
pretty much
the they can be a carriar of a certain gene
^^^^thats what i just said
they can be orange bt have white parents
the 2 parents are heterozygus
orange and whit parents
because they both have to carry a domonat and resesive trait to have both white and orange kittens
that call because a parent has a certain color they can pass on a gene that effects the child
Not exactly the same but pretty close.
if both parents have AA all the kids will have the domonate genotype
i think i will be whit and 1 will be orange
if both parents have Aa then the kids will have a chance to be white or orange
because of there inheritence
I'm so bad at explaining this.. um the kids will probably have the dominate genotype because that's what usually happens.
ya
im confused im done.

Hey :)
hiiii guys!
Cats?
No Kittys :)
The cats will turn out as White or Brown
hey its pierce
I'm guessing orange is dominant.
hiiiiiiiiiiiiiii bestest friendd<3
hi
but yeah, i think thatt its either brown or white
but the brown is dominant
white is recessive
CC = Brown cc = white ?
yeah
or its Cc for Brown
G's? Where did they get G from?
O.O
all the kity's are dominant because og Gg
I don't know.... but I agreee with autumn cause of domiance
Isn't Sage suppose to tell us if we're right?
Noooooo, he's just gunna cut us off lol
they have to have at least one captial
to be dominant
Obviously the dad is white...
wait, how is he white?
The dad has to be white for white kitty's to come out
<3
im sooooooooooo confused
Gg.
brown is dominant GG and white is recessive gg
ok
Can you explain it?
if he is heterzygous then he must be ggBACKSLASH
He can be Heterozygous because of the dominat allele G
*Gg
so since hes heterzygous recessive
domiant**
his G takes over the little G
g*
so if their both Gg then their will be 25% of getting a white kitty and 75% of getting a brown kitty
Gg and gg?
It's 50% of white and 50% orange
no no no
its 75 for white
NOOOO
75 for brown bc brown is dominant
its 50 50
25 for white bc white is recessice
nooo!
*recessive
it's 4 orange and 4 white
yea sorry i thought we was still on problem 2
For #3. Gg and gg so it'll be Gg,Gg,gg,gg.
that's why i was so confused. but the Genotype is 50% for white, and 50% for brown/orange.
i agree with autumn
and gina
